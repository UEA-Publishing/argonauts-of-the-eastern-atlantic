singularly interesting objects, comply with the wish of the
late king of Otaheite, who, when he abandoned the idolatrous
and cruel religion of his fathers, requested the Missionaries
either to consume these idols in the fire, or “ send them to
Britain, that the English people might see what foolish gods
they had been accustomed to adore.'
It is hoped that a view of these “ trophies of Christianity
will inspire the spectators with gratitude to God for his great
goodness to our native land, in favouring us so abundantly
with the means of grace, and the knowledge of his salvation;
and at the same time, with thankfulness that these blessings
have, in some happy degree, been communicated, and by our
means, to the distant isles of the Southern Ocean. Many of
the articles in this Collection are calculated to excite, in the
pious mind, feelings of deep commisseration for the hundreds
of millions of the human race, still the vassals of ignorance
and superstition; whilst the success with which God has
already crowned our labours, should act as a powerful sti¬
mulus to efforts, far more zealous than ever, for the conver¬
sion of the heathen.

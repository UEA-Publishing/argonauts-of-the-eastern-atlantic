**Transcription**

in diameter, naked, and apparently glandulous ; a long
black beard like the Gnoo, covering the throat from the
chin to the breast ; the nose and mouth somewhat like
that of the Ox, but more broad and flat ; the colour of the
body ash-grey.

Barrow's Travels, p. 37.[^1]

This is a very rare animal; was shot on the banks of the
*Malalareen* river, in the Boschuana country, by Mr. Camp¬
bell's party, July, 1813.[^2]

3. The **CAPE ANT-EATER,**[^3]
Snout long; ears large ; tail tapering to the tip : inhabits
the Cape of Good Hope ; nearly the size of the Hog ;
burrows in the ground ; sleeps by day, and prowls by
night; his muscular strength is so great, that it is scarcely
possible to drag him out of his hole when wounded.<br>
The food of this animal consists principally of Ants. On
arriving at an ant-hill he scratches it up with his claws,
and then unfolds his slender tongue, covered with a
clammy matter or saliva, in which the Ants become en¬
tangled in great numbers ; the tongue is then drawn back
into his mouth, and he swallows thousands of them alive.


4. The **CASSOWARY,**[^4]
Three-toed ; inhabits the torrid zone in Asia; feeds on
vegetables; is, like the Ostrich, unable to fly, but runs
with great swiftness when aided by its wings ; is very
fierce, and grunts like a swine. The eggs, two of which
accompany the bird, are greenish, with deeper spots of
the same colour.


**Over Case A.**

**THREE LARGE DISHES,** cut out of the solid wood,
and used by the natives of Otaheite at their meals, &c.

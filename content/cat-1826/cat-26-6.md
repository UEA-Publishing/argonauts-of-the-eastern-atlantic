in diameter, naked, and apparently glandulous; a long
black beard like the Gnoo, covering the throat from the
chin to the breast ; the nose and mouth somewhat like
that of the Ox, but more broad and flat ; the colour of the
body ash-grey.
Vide KoKoon, in Daniels Sketches und
Barrow's Truvels, p. 37.
This is a very rare animal; was shot on the banks of the
Malalareen river, in the Boschuana country, by Mr. Camp¬
bell's party, July, 1813.

3. The CAPE ANT-EATER,
Snout long; ears large; tail tapering to the tip : inhabits
the Cape of Good Hope; nearly the size of the Hog;
burrows in the ground; sleeps by day, and prowls by
night; his muscular strength is so great, that it is scarcely
possible to drag him out of his hole when wounded.
The food of this animal consists principally of Ants. On
arriving at an ant-hill he scratches it up with his claws,
and then unfolds his slender tongue, covered with a
clammy matter or saliva, in which the Ants become en¬
tangled in great numbers ; the tongue is then drawn back
into his mouth, and he swallows thousands of them alive.


4. The CASSOWARY,
Three-toed; inhabits the torrid zone in Asia; feeds on
vegetables; is, like the Ostrich, unable to fly, but runs
with great swiftness when aided by its wings; is very
fierce, and grunts like a swine. The eggs, two of which
accompany the bird, are greenish, with deeper spots of
the same colour.

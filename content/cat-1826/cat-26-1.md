## Notes
[^1]: The museum moved to Austin Friars in early 1823, having opened at the Old Jewry in April 1815, when it was open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11am to 3pm. Wednesday opening was announced in the *Missionary Chronicle* in August 1824, when the printing of a *Descriptive Catalogue* was also announced. See: 'Missionary Museum' in *the Evangelical Magazine & Missionary Chronicle*, August 1824, p.365.
[^2]: Although only open on Wednesdays when the catalogue was published in 1826, the museum was evidently open an hour later during the summer months: Lady Day is the Feast of the Annunciation, normally celebrated on 25 March. Michaelmas is the Feast of Saints Michael, Gabriel and Raphael, normally celebrated on 19 September.

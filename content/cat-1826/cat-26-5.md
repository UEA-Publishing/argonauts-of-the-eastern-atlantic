1. THE ZEBRA, or WILD Ass;
With a short erect mane; the head and body striped with
brown lines downwards; the legs and thighs crossways;
tail like that of an ass size of a common mule.
This elegant quadruped inhabits the plains of Africa ; but
on the sight of man runs into the woods and disappears.
Zebras are gregarious and very swift, but being vicious
and untameable, are useless to man.
Possibly this may be the Wild Ass mentioned in the book
of Job, chap. xxxix. 5—8.
« Who hath sent forth the wild-ass at large?
« And the reins of the wild mule who hath loosed?
Whose house I have ma de the wilderness,
« And his house the salt waste.
« He mocketh at the uproar of the city,
«And the jargon of the driver he heedeth not ;
« He traverseth the mountains, his pasturage;
“ And hunteth after every green shoot.

2. The KOKOON of the BOSCHUANAS. The only known
specimen in England.

Gnoo, but is of a larger size; tail long and black, re¬
sembling that of the horse ; its mane flowing over its
shoulders, and continuing to the middle of the back;
forehead like that of the Buffalo, covered with an osseous
excrescence, being in fact the root of the horns, which
are terminated in fine pointed extremities ; on each cheek,
a little below the eye, a spot of a circular form, an inch

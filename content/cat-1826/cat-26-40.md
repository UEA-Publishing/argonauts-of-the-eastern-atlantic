>"The bushes were uncommonly troublesome, especially
that called Stop-a-while, tearing the oxen, waggons and

bush, that with much difficulty I got extricated; for no
sooner had I got disengaged from one hook, than I found
two or three others had got hold of my clothes; or when
breaking the twig by which I was detained, another
caught the arm that broke it."â€”Campbell's Travels,

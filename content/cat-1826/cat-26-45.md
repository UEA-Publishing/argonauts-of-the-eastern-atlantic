Over Case I.


MODELS OF CANOES.

A GLOBE, representing the religion of the different coun¬
tries, by Rev. Mr. Sabine.


ABOVE THESE,


TABLETS, on which are inscribed the names of Ladies and
Gentlemen, who have generously left Legacies to the
Society, and who, though dead, still contribute to
the cause of Missions, by the interest of the monies
bequeathed.
— And yet there is room.—Luke.


Three Glass Cases,


IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM,

On one Side of one of them, Various Specimens of ROCKS
and MINERALS, chiefly from South Africa, among
which are the ASBESTOS, and the IRON ORE,
with which the natives paint their bodies.

Asbestos —a native fossil stone, which may be split into
threads and filaments, fine and silky. It has the wonder¬
ful property of remaining unconsumed in the fire, which
only whitens it. The ancients are said to have made
paper and napkins of it ; also shrouds for royal funerals,
to inclose the corpse on the pile, and preserve the ashes
of it from being mingled with those of the wood.

Some of these specimens were found by Mr. Campbell in
South Africa, where they are very plentiful.

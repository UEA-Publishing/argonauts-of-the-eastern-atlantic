                  Encouraged by academic colleagues to generate a scholarly
                  monograph on the museum and collection of the London
                  Missionary Society, on which I have been working since 2006,
                  whenever I sat down to do this, I struggled with the
                  constraints and process of paper-based publication.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is my attempt to give my research a form that makes
                  sense.

                  In 1922, Bronislaw Malinowksi published
                  <em>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</em>, his account of Kula
                  voyages off the eastern tip of New Guinea. During these
                  voyages, participants aimed to acquire Kula valuables through
                  ceremonial exchange – necklaces of red spondylus shell, called
                  <em>soulava,</em> and bracelets of white shell, called
                  <em>mwali.</em> By acquiring, holding and subsequently
                  exchanging these goods, certain men were able to advance and
                  enhance their status.

                <p>
                  Malinowski’s book has come to be seen as the archetypal
                  ethnographic text, inaugurating what has been called ‘the
                  phase of modernism in English-speaking anthropology’ (Ardener
                  1985; Strathern 1990, 1987). One way of understanding the
                  title of Malinowksi’s book is to regard the islanders as early
                  twentieth-century equivalents of the sailors who crewed the
                  <em>Argo</em> of Ancient Greek myth, a ship captained by Jason
                  and protected by the Gods. But <em>Argonauts</em> was not the
                  only book published in 1922 to adopt a classicising title –
                  James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> – a central text in the canon
                  of literary modernism – transposed the voyages and adventures
                  of Odysseus, chronicled in Homer’s Odyssey, onto an ordinary
                  day in Dublin, with Leopold Bloom as its hero.

                <p>
                  Modernism as an aesthetic and literary movement was
                  consolidated in the years after the First World War – a period
                  in which the world was essentially remade. In 1922, after
                  around 750 years as a centre of English power, Dublin became
                  the capital of the independent Irish Free State. Old ideas and
                  established authorities were challenged as a new generation of
                  men, Malinowksi and Joyce among them, asserted themselves. If
                  the <em>Argonauts</em> were the Kiriwinans of the Kula ring,
                  then it seems that like Leopold Bloom in <em>Ulysses</em>,
                  Malinowski was the modern(ist) Jason – the legendary hero
                  tasked with bringing back the golden fleece.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It helps here to know that one of the major works of
                  anthropology before the First World War was
                  <em>The Golden Bough</em> by James Frazer, originally
                  published in two volumes in 1890, three volumes in 1900 and an
                  incredible twelve volumes in the third edition between 1906
                  and 1915. Frazer’s comparative compendium of mythology
                  developed in relation to the <em>Rex Nemorensis</em>, the
                  priest-king of the sacred grove on the shores of Lake Nemi in
                  Italy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to become the priest-king, one had to kill the
                  existing priest in combat, after taking the golden bough from
                  one of the trees in the sacred grove. Frazer suggested that
                  the institution of the death and reinstallation of the
                  priest-king was an embodiment of the dying and reviving solar
                  god, central to mythological ideas all over the world –
                  including the death and resurrection of Jesus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Malinowski himself had been inspired to become an
                  anthropologist by reading <em>the Golden Bough</em> in three
                  volumes, borrowed from the University of Cracow library:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>I realised then that anthropology, as presented by Sir
                      James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much
                      devotion as any of her elder and more exact sister studies
                      and I became bound to the service of Frazerian
                      anthropology.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-intro-fn3" id="page-intro-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  If Frazer was the reigning priest-king of early
                  twentieth-century British Anthropology, Malinowski’s
                  publication of <em>Argonauts</em> can be read as him
                  presenting his own golden bough. In asking James Frazer to
                  write book’s preface, Malinowski was essentially asking for
                  the inauguration of his own reign – like Jason claiming his
                  rightful place as king following presentation of the golden
                  fleece. Malinowski is remembered for developing the notion of
                  the charter myth, and he certainly deployed the myth of his
                  fieldwork in the Trobriands as a charter from which to
                  establish Social Anthropology as a new approach.

                <p>
                  The Golden Bough_ was also a significant influence on Joyce
                  (as well as T.S. Eliot, who published
                  <em>The Waste Land</em> in 1922), as well as other modernists
                  such as Joseph Conrad. Indeed, Malinowski admired Conrad, a
                  fellow Pole, telling Brenda Seligman that ‘Rivers is the Rider
                  Haggard of Anthropology, I shall be his Conrad!’ (Young 2004,
                  236). By aligning W.H.R. Rivers (who died in 1922) with Rider
                  Haggard, Malinowski was suggesting he exemplified an imperial
                  tradition of British writing about the non-European ‘other’
                  which he hoped to overturn in the way Conrad’s
                  <em>Heart of Darkness</em> upended romantic Imperial
                  narratives into a denunciation of colonialism, highlighting
                  the ways it dehumanised the Europeans who participated in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Malinowski presented his work as inaugurating
                  something of a revolution in Anthropology, his approach was
                  significantly shaped by his engagement with Frazer, providing
                  at the very least an explanation for the title of his book. In
                  the same way that Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em> is
                  structured around the story of a European’s voyage to the
                  interior of the African continent, where he comes to dominate
                  and rule, Malinowski’s account, while ostensibly about the
                  Kula, also emphasises his own heroic role as an ethnographer
                  who gains an understanding of the operation of Kula that is
                  essentially superior to that of those who participate in it.
                  This is an anthropological version of ‘the hero’s journey’
                  myth – explored by Joseph Campbell’s 1949 book,
                  <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</em> (a major influence on
                  George Lucas’ Star Wars franchise and not unrelated to what
                  Teju Cole, in 2012, called ‘the White-Saviour Industrial
                  complex’).

                  Across the literary and artistic manifestations of modernism,
                  a common theme is the European appropriation and of ‘the
                  primitive’ in order to refresh or renew the artistic and
                  intellectual traditions of Europe. It was not uncommon for
                  mid-century Europeans to see themselves as the ones who
                  ‘really’ understood artistic or ceremonial practices in other
                  parts of world. Although twentieth-century Social Anthropology
                  has long been recognised as a modernist form of
                  <em>Writing Culture</em> (Clifford and Marcus 1986), the fact
                  is that <em>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</em> is still
                  widely regarded as an exemplary ethnographic text.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, Malinowski’s description of romantically isolated
                  fieldwork remains the standard against which many doctoral
                  anthropology students measure their own efforts, suggesting it
                  has been hard for the discipline to escape the dominating and
                  perhaps domineering influence of the modernists, whose charter
                  myths continue to position them as founding ancestors, or
                  priest-kings in the cult of Social Anthropology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For all Malinowksi’s iconoclastic ambitions, the narrative
                  structure of his account betrays a continuity with older
                  European accounts of encounter with other parts of the world.
                  It is striking that central targets for the Modernist
                  generation, from which they sought to distance themselves,
                  perhaps as a result of the what Freud in 1917 called the
                  ‘narcissism of small differences’, were missionaries, but also
                  the museum collections – assembled by anthropological museums
                  during the previous thirty years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modernist anthropologists railed against what they represented
                  as ‘conjectural history’ – the efforts of those who attempted
                  to build frameworks for human history extending beyond the
                  European old world on the basis of facts and artefacts
                  assembled in Europe – an approach increasingly derided as
                  ‘armchair anthropology’. Modernism, and anthropological
                  modernism in particular, was unrelentingly presentist (Fardon
                  2005). The aim was to explain the operation of society by
                  reference to its contemporary features and characteristics, in
                  the way an anatomist might explain the function of different
                  organs of the body without reference to their evolutionary
                  history.

                  But Malinowski did not swim to the Trobriand Islands. His
                  access to the field, like that of many anthropologists of his
                  generation was made substantially possible by established
                  networks of Christian missionaries who had operated in Africa
                  and the Pacific for over a century. In the case of the
                  Trobriands, the Methodist missionary M.K. Gilmour had already
                  been stationed at Kiriwina for 14 years when Malinowski
                  arrived in 1915 (Young 1984, 17). Many of Malinowski’s
                  immediate predecessors, the first generation of professional
                  anthropologists, found employment in museums filled by
                  collections assembled in Europe largely through the efforts of
                  previous generations of missionaries.

                  In <em>the Right to Look- a counterhistory of visuality</em>,
                  Nicholas Mirzoeff (2011) has suggested that the missionary can
                  be regarded as the metonymic figure of what he called the
                  ‘Imperial Complex of Visuality’, dominant between 1860 and
                  1945 – as heroes who brought ‘Light into Darkness’ as part of
                  a global “pastorate”. This draws on Michel Foucault’s insight
                  that many of the technologies of governmentality of the modern
                  state were assimilated from forms of Christian pastoral power
                  (Goulder 2007). Thus an enquiry into missionary practice and
                  image making has the potential to illuminate what Talal Asad
                  (2003) has called <em>Formations of the Secular.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Historians such as Boyd Hilton (1988) have demonstrated the
                  significant influence that the 18th century evangelical
                  revival had on British intellectual and cultural forms during
                  the nineteenth century. I would go as far as to suggest that
                  the public museums that took shape in the last quarter of the
                  nineteenth century, as part of what Tony Bennett (1988) has
                  called the ‘exhibitionary complex’, can be regarded as an
                  expansion of the ‘missionary exhibitionary complex’ which
                  developed in evangelical circles earlier in the century. My
                  intention in presenting chronologically ordered chapters is to
                  provide a more detailed insight into the development of these
                  related exhibitionary complexes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, I remain conscious of the textual form I am creating
                  – it would easy to describe a narrative arc from origin,
                  through rise, to decline and fall. But would this simply be an
                  appealing way to shape a story out of the messy details of
                  historical events and sources? A Foucauldian genealogy might
                  trace relationships of descent and alliance, but my intention
                  here is less to construct a genealogy than to provide a
                  gallery of ancestral portraits, which the reader/viewer is
                  encouraged to explore in order to recognise and identify
                  family resemblances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Marilyn Strathern (1990) has described the typical approach of
                  modernist anthropology to both artefacts and events as one
                  that makes sense of them in relation to a context. She has
                  contrasted this with what she has called a Melanesian approach
                  to images, whether events or artefacts, as embodying history
                  themselves – they do not need to be “explained” by reference
                  to events outside themselves, but are known by their effects.
                  An image or artefact, when approached as a
                  <em>prestation</em> (or gift) demands reciprocation, so that
                  it comes to be understood through the construction of further
                  artefacts in order to see what their further effects will be,
                  with revelations coming as something of a surprise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would collapse Strathern’s dichotomy between the Melanesian
                  and European approaches (which is itself essentially
                  Modernist) by suggesting that the texts constructed to make
                  sense of things by “Europeans”, by which she essentially means
                  modernist anthropologists (Strathern recognises that museum
                  curators are more like “Melanesians” than her “Europeans”) are
                  artefacts themselves, containing their own contexts. In a
                  world in which the British Library is a distinct institution
                  from the British Museum, we might think of texts as unlike
                  other artefacts, but it is in fact not long since they were
                  part of a single institution (1973). Indeed, most libraries
                  contain artefacts that could happily form part of a museum
                  collection, and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One can read Malinowski’s text as an artefact of a particular
                  type, constructed to evoke a context for the Kula that will
                  allow himself and other Europeans to make sense of it. But
                  typically, the institutions of human life do not come with
                  such manuals. One joins the game of life in the midst of play,
                  and learns the rules by watching and joining in. In Roy
                  Wagner’s (1981) terms, Malinowski, as the ethnographer,
                  “invents” the culture of the Trobriands through the
                  construction of his text(s). Strathern suggests that as part
                  of the modernist approach to Anthropology “it is taken for
                  granted that we study the significance which such artefacts
                  have for the people who make them, and thus their
                  interpretations of them”, but if these assumptions were at
                  least identifiable by 1990, I suggest they should no longer be
                  taken for granted.

                  A hundred years after the publication of Malinowksi’s
                  <em>Argonauts</em>, I am seeking to revisit the moment of
                  possibility represented by 1922, a return to what Michael
                  North (1999) has called the ‘scene of the modern’. While the
                  COVID19 pandemic has been very different to the First World
                  War, it nevertheless provides a break from business as usual
                  which makes it possible to consider alternative ways of
                  approaching things.

                  How best can one write about human life in a way that resists
                  the urge to endlessly contextualise – a tendency to lapse into
                  an essentially theological mode of writing that attempts to
                  elucidate what Malinowski liked to call ‘the native’s point of
                  view’? Who are /were ‘the natives’ in encounters between
                  missionaries and the people they worked with, and did they
                  really have a single point of view? Is it possible to capture
                  the contingency, uncertainty and provisional nature of much of
                  human life by constructing our accounts differently?

                  David Graeber and David Wengrow (2021; 5, 24) have recently
                  challenged us to write history ‘as if it consisted of people
                  one would have been able to talk to, when they were still
                  alive’ as part of an attempt to construct a new science of
                  history that ‘restores our ancestors to their full humanity’.
                  It is to this challenge that I have attempted to respond.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In his work on the encounters between missionaries and the
                  Yoruba, in what is now Nigeria, J.D.Y. Peel (1995; 2000) drew
                  attention to the centrality of narratives, both in terms of
                  how they structure historical accounts, but also the way in
                  which they were used by participants in these encounters to
                  make sense of their own experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In response to the work of the Comaroffs (1991, 1997), whose
                  work concentrated on the connections between missionary
                  encounters and the expansion of global capitalism, Peel has
                  suggested that accounts of missionary encounters that do not
                  recognise the centrality of religious narratives runs the risk
                  of reading like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.

                  World religions like Christianity, Peel (1995, 9) suggests,
                  are long <em>durée</em> ‘vehicles of trans-historical memory,
                  ceaselessly re-activated in the consciousness of their
                  adherents’. Those engaged in missionary encounters frequently
                  compared and judged their own actions on the basis of biblical
                  precedent, drawing on the complex strands of both the Old and
                  New Testaments to make sense of their own encounters.

                  In constructing his own account, Peel worried about ‘how to
                  simplify a complicated and many-stranded story without
                  distorting its essential elements’ (Peel 2000, 44), ultimately
                  arriving at a material metaphor:

                  It is striking that in setting out his vision of the history
                  of human thought, Frazer (1911, 307-8) constructed a similar
                  material metaphor:

                    and you will remark that, while the black thread and white
                    chequer still run through it, there rests on the middle
                    portion of the web, where religion has entered most deeply

                  In constructing an artefactual history of the London
                  Missionary Society, my ambition is similarly to construct a
                  narrative out of multiple interlocking strands, coming in and
                  out of conjunction with one another in different ways at
                  different times.

                  Textual models range from nineteenth century novels such as
                  George Elliot’s <em>Middlemarch</em> and Herman Melville’s
                  <em>Moby Dick</em> to more recent works such as David
                  Mitchell’s <em>Cloud Atlas,</em> or even Deleuze and
                  Guattari’s <em>A Thousand Plateaus.</em> But in the deeper
                  past we might consider the multi-stranded text of Herodotus’
                  <em>Histories</em>, or even the books of the Bible itself. In
                  attempting to go beyond what Ann-Laura Stoler (2009) has
                  called ‘familiar stories with predictable plots’, we have a
                  range of textual artefacts to consider as models that do not
                  conform to modernist monomyths – a significant example drawn
                  from twentieth century anthropology would be Gregory Bateson’s
                  (1936) <em>Naven</em>.

                  I am not advocating a straightforwardly neo-Frazerian
                  approach, but I do feel that it may be revealing to consider
                  missionary encounters, as well as the way they have been
                  narrated in light of the archetypical story of the priest-king
                  at Nemi. Indeed, I am tempted to regard many of the artefacts
                  collected and brought to Europe as essentially equivalent to
                  Trobriand Kula valuables, but also to the Golden Fleece which
                  Jason returned with to prove his right to rule.

                  The widespread adoption of Christianity in large parts of the
                  world over the past two centuries, including Africa and the
                  Pacific in particular, is a transformation of world-historical
                  significance that cannot be accounted for simply by the
                  imposition of European power, or the cultural logic of
                  capitalism – many missionaries were essentially powerless
                  strangers, at least at the point they arrived.

                  I take further inspiration from Chinua Achebe’s 1958
                  <em>Things Fall Apart</em> – an African response to Conrad’s
                  <em>Heart of Darkness</em> which recognises the tensions
                  inherent in existing structures of power, and the forms of
                  possibility that the arrival of outsiders missionaries
                  presented for many people. The stranger missionaries did not
                  become priest-kings entirely by their own efforts.

                  If the functionalist anthropology of the Modernists concerned
                  itself with how society maintains itself as a functioning
                  system in a steady state or dynamic equilibrium, giving rise
                  to a conception of culture as essentially inherited and
                  determinative, then in a world structured around forms of
                  managerialism intent on maintaining an unsustainable status
                  quo, it has become increasingly urgent to find ways of writing
                  about the mechanisms of societal transformation. How does
                  society renew itself? How does newness enter the world (Bhabha
                  1994)?

                  Taking in oceans and continents in a few strides, it was hard
                  not to feel at the centre of things as I walked onto ‘the
                  Great Map’. Covering the floor of the observation deck at the
                  UK’s National Maritime Museum, it reduces the globe to
                  something that can be over-seen and over-stepped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The museum in which it takes centre stage looks up towards the
                  hill where the Royal Observatory is perched – home of the
                  Greenwich meridian and zero point for a reckoning of time.
                  Rooted in one location, at the middle of the map, the museum
                  is a ship of time, with deck-like galleries of public display
                  and dark hold-like stores carrying vast cargoes into the
                  future.

                  I was there for the gala opening of the museum’s
                  <a href="#page-https-www-rmg-co-uk-national-maritime-museum-attractions-sackler-gallery-pacific-encounters" target="_blank">Pacific Encounters gallery</a>. On a raised platform at the north end of the map, a pair of
                  dancers wearing fibre dance skirts with shells around their
                  necks were performing, accompanied by drummers from
                  <a href="#page-https-www-mattersmusical-com-artists-beats-of-polynesia" target="_blank"><em>Beats of Polynesia</em>,</a>
                  a London based collective whose
                  <a href="#page-https-twitter-com-beatspolynesia-lang-en" target="_blank">X profile</a>
                  (formerly Twitter) suggests they exist to ‘bring a taste of
                  the Pacific islands to the United Kingdom &amp; Europe’.

                <p>
                  It was 19 September 2018, but their performance recalled other
                  times and other places. In particular, it made me think of a
                  painting, recently hung in a gallery on the other side of the
                  Great Map – <em>The Cession of Matavai</em> – as it is often
                  known. Painted by the English painter Robert Smirke, it
                  commemorates the arrival of the first group of British
                  missionaries at Tahiti in 1797, intent on taking a taste of
                  the UK and Europe, and in particular Protestant Christianity,
                  to the heart of the Pacific.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the European perspective that the painting provides was
                  only ever one side of the story, illustrating some of the ways
                  in which Pacific islands and Islanders have been imagined and
                  visualised in Europe over the past 250 years. The new gallery
                  formed part of the Endeavour Galleries project, named for the
                  HMS <em>Endeavour</em>, a British Navy research vessel that
                  left the British Isles in 1768 under the command of Captain
                  James Cook.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>Endeavour</em>’s main mission had been to observe the
                  passage of Venus across the face of the sun at Tahiti, on the
                  other side of the globe. The story of Cook’s voyages has been
                  so frequently told that it has become part of the myth through
                  which Britain has come to understand itself and its encounters
                  with other parts of the world. The heroic tale of the son of a
                  farm labourer, who through his own ability and hard work rose
                  to command a ship, to literally put Australia on the map, and
                  who in the end was murdered on a beach in Hawai’i, remains
                  hard for us to escape.

                  However, in recent years, statues to Captain Cook across the
                  Pacific have been a focus for protests about colonialism and
                  its contemporary legacies. On Thursday 1 July 2021, a Cook
                  statue in Victoria on Vancouver Island was torn down and
                  thrown into the harbour by protesters highlighting the ongoing
                  mistreatment of Indigenous women and children in contemporary
                  Canada.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-1-fn1" id="page-chapter-1-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>

                <p>
                  We clearly need to unpack the processes by which white
                  European men were fashioned into the heroes around which so
                  many of the tales of colonial history came to be told. In
                  trying to develop accounts of the past that are recognisable
                  to the descendants of the colonised, as well as the colonisers
                  – as well as those of us whose ancestors came from both sides
                  of what can, at times, feel like an unbreachable historical
                  antagonism – we need to de-centre these historical celebrities
                  within the tales that we tell.

                  Disrupting what Ann-Laura Stoler has called familiar stories
                  with predictable plots, our challenge is to find other ways of
                  narrating the histories of encounter between Europe and other
                  parts of the world. As an artefactual history, with its
                  primary focus on the things through which relationships
                  between Europeans and others were mediated, this work is an
                  experimental attempt to respond to this challenge.

                  A couple of weeks before the gallery opening at Greenwich, I
                  left my job as a curator at the
                  <a href="#page-https-maa-cam-ac-uk" target="_blank">Museum of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology</a>
                  in Cambridge. The collection there includes a number of
                  historic artefacts collected during Cook’s voyages that remain
                  celebrities within the collection. Regularly visited by
                  researchers and loaned for exhibitions around the world, their
                  carbon footprint was significantly higher than mine in most of
                  the years I worked at the museum, and in the anniversary year
                  of 2018 in particular.

                  Greenwich’s Pacific Encounters gallery is framed by Cook’s
                  voyages, showcasing the dramatic oil paintings of William
                  Hodges, a young theatre scene painter who accompanied Cook on
                  his second voyage from 1772 to 1775. Hodges was a romantic who
                  depicted Tahiti as a latter-day Eden in the paintings he
                  completed after his return to London, paid for by the British
                  Admiralty.

                  Hodges made a number of paintings of Matavai Bay and
                  experimented with how to present this landscape – a natural
                  paradise, untouched by European influence, or alternatively a
                  backdrop against which to contrast the sailing vessels, forms
                  of dress and buildings of one island people with that of
                  another.

                <p>
                  While the Cession of Matavai owes something to these paintings
                  of the bay, it depicts events two decades after Hodges had
                  left. I had last seen the painting halfway up the stairs of
                  the library at the University of London’s
                  <a href="#page-https-www-soas-ac-uk-library" target="_blank">School of Oriental and African Studies</a>, where a number a palm prints suggested it was not quite out
                  of student reach. Five years earlier I was involved in
                  brokering the transfer of the painting, along with a number of
                  other artefacts, across London from the Council for World
                  Mission in Westminster to the National Maritime Museum in
                  Greenwich.

                <p>
                  Since then, the painting had been professionally conserved,
                  and I had been told that the removal of two hundred years of
                  London grime had revealed previously obscure details. What
                  this painting, alongside other missionary artefacts displayed
                  in the gallery allowed the Maritime Museum to do for the first
                  time, was to tell a story of Pacific Encounters that included
                  Britain’s history of overseas missionary engagements alongside
                  the naval history that had been central to the museum’s
                  purpose since its establishment in 1934. No less maritime in
                  nature, missionary history has frequently been told through
                  accounts of ‘heroes’ in the mode of Captain Cook. But it is
                  also a history of encounter that extends far beyond fairly
                  short-lived expeditions of exploration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Missionaries generally stayed in the places they were sent to
                  for longer periods, and the success of their work – convincing
                  people to convert to Christianity – depended upon developing
                  detailed understandings of the lives of the people amongst
                  whom they lived, even if their ultimate intention was to
                  transform these. If the museum was going to tell a story of
                  Britain’s Pacific Encounters, I was pleased it now extended
                  beyond the initial impressions of Captain Cook and William
                  Hodges. But the Cession of Matavai remains an initial
                  impression.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With Hodges’ mountains in the background, it shows a group of
                  people assembled around a clearing, where the light,
                  undoubtedly signifying the presence of God, shines brightly.
                  It is an image of missionary arrival that imagines a future
                  which has become our history. The painting was commissioned
                  from the London painter Robert Smirke by the Directors,
                  effectively board members, of the recently established
                  Missionary Society. Smirke had never been to Tahiti, although
                  he had likely seen Hodges’ paintings. He was, however,
                  experienced at creating images based on literary texts, from
                  Shakespeare to Cervantes. In this case the text was the
                  journal of James Wilson, captain of the ship that delivered
                  the missionaries to Tahiti.

                  Captain Wilson, shown in profile, hat-in-hand at the
                  centre-right of the painting, was in many ways a missionary
                  Captain Cook, although his life story was one of sin and
                  suffering, followed by conversion and redemption. A veteran of
                  the Battle of Bunker Hill in the American War of Independence,
                  he joined the East India Company as a naval officer, just as
                  Warren Hastings was expanding the power base of the Company to
                  some consternation back in London.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Captured by the French, Wilson escaped by swimming to shore
                  where he was recaptured by the forces of Hyder Ali, Sultan of
                  Mysore, and imprisoned for nearly two years. On release he
                  enriched himself working for the Company in India, finding
                  religion only after his retirement back in Britain, still in
                  his thirties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wilson read in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> about the
                  intention to send missionaries to the Pacific and volunteered
                  his services. For evangelicals, motivated by an increasingly
                  central understanding of divine Grace, it was precisely
                  Wilson’s earlier life of sin followed by conversion that
                  demonstrated he was God’s choice for the job.

                  The missionary movement gained significant momentum in the
                  early 1790s, prompted, so the story goes, by the Christian
                  cobbler, William Carey’s 1792 pamphlet ‘An Enquiry into the
                  Obligations of Christians to use means for the Conversion of
                  the Heathen’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-1-fn2" id="page-chapter-1-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  This led to the establishment of ‘the Baptist Society for
                  propagating the Gospel among the Heathen’ at Kettering, which
                  sent Carey to India in June 1793. A letter home in 1794
                  prompted ministers from a range of churches in Bristol to
                  reflect on what they could do to build on his efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This led to David Bogue, the Scottish Minister of an
                  Independent Church in Gosport, Hampshire, to issue an appeal
                  in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em>, central to which was a
                  sense of debt and obligation, both to God and to early
                  missionaries to the British Isles. According to Bogue, the
                  spirit of <em>Justice</em> cried out:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Ye were once Pagans, living in cruel and abominable
                    idolatry. The servants of Jesus came from other lands, and
                    preached His Gospel among you. Hence your knowledge of
                    salvation. And ought ye not, as an equitable compensation
                    for their kindness, to send messengers to the nations which
                    are in like condition with yourselves of old, to entreat
                    them that they turn from their dumb idols to the living God,
                    and wait for His Son from heaven? Verily their debtors ye
                    are.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-1-fn3" id="page-chapter-1-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Missionary efforts were imagined in late eighteenth century
                  Britain as a ‘Gift of Grace’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-1-fn4" id="page-chapter-1-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  But they were understood as a return gift, acknowledging the
                  obligation placed on Christian Britain, ‘once an island of
                  idolatrous barbarians’, by a gift of the Word received by
                  pagan ancestors, generations previously. As George Burder, an
                  engraver who became a minister in Coventry, put it on the eve
                  of the founding of the Missionary Society in 1795:

                  Established in 1795, the Missionary Society, as it was known
                  at the time, consisted of Christians drawn from across the
                  British Isles, from dissenting churches as well as
                  evangelicals within the established Church of England. Its
                  constitution declared that ‘The sole object is to spread the
                  knowledge of Christ among heathen and other unenlightened
                  nations.’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-1-fn6" id="page-chapter-1-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although its model as a non-denominational society was the
                  <em>Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade</em>, it was neither North America nor Africa that beckoned most
                  strongly. The choice of Tahiti as the first location for
                  missionary activity was influenced by the accounts of Cook’s
                  voyages, which circulated widely, accompanied by prints, some
                  of which were developed from the paintings of Hodges, as well
                  as others made from drawings by John Webber, an artist who
                  accompanied Cook on his third voyage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the years after Cook’s death in 1779, Tahiti became central
                  to the evangelical vision of Thomas Haweis, a Cornish
                  Anglican. Haweis had been chaplain to Selina Hastings,
                  Countess of Huntingdon, who had been part of the Methodist
                  evangelical revival during the mid-eighteenth century. She had
                  supported missions in Sierra Leone as well as in North America
                  to both Indigenous Americans as well as formerly enslaved
                  people, and following her death in 1791, Haweis retained
                  considerable influence as her principal trustee.

                  Haweis had previously tried, unsuccessfully, to send
                  missionaries to Tahiti with Captain Bligh, so the
                  establishment of the Missionary Society provided another
                  opportunity. He argued that the main barriers to missionary
                  work: inhospitable climates, absolute governments (as found in
                  China and Japan), the prejudices of false religion (such as
                  Islam), and the difficulty of learning new languages, could
                  most easily be overcome in Tahiti where he thought weather was
                  good, food plentiful, government mild, religious prejudices
                  minimal and the language easy to learn. Haweis personally put
                  up a sum of £500, nearly ten years wages for a skilled
                  tradesman at the time, to fund the mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The problem with starting missionary work at Tahiti, however,
                  is that it lies in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, so is far
                  from easy to get to. The directors of the society decided to
                  buy a ship, the <em>Duff</em>. Preparations were overseen by
                  Captain Wilson who recruited a crew of twenty-two, including
                  his nephew William Wilson as First Mate. William is shown in
                  the painting standing next to his uncle with his right hand in
                  his waistcoat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile, the directors recruited 30 missionaries. They
                  including four ordained ministers, but also a roll of
                  late-eighteenth century trades: six carpenters, a cabinet
                  maker, two bricklayers, a gardener, a cotton manufacturer, a
                  linen draper, two weavers, two tailors, two shoemakers, a
                  hatter, a shopkeeper, a harness maker, a surgeon, a
                  blacksmith, a cooper, a butcher, and for some reason, a
                  gentleman’s servant. These men had between them six wives and
                  three male children, aged 12, two, and 16 weeks.

                  On 10 August 1796, the <em>Duff</em> sailed down the Thames
                  with its godly passengers and crew, flying the mission flag
                  depicting three doves on a purple background, each carrying an
                  olive branch. By the time the ship left English waters on 24
                  September, the butcher and his wife, struck down by
                  seasickness, had returned to shore and the twelve-year-old
                  boy, already ill, had died of consumption.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By mid-November the ship was at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, and
                  having struggled to round Cape Horn, Captain Wilson took an
                  easterly route south of the Cape of Good Hope, Australia and
                  New Zealand before heading north to Tahiti. The missionary
                  ship sailed nearly 14,000 miles in 97 days without sight of
                  land, encountering only one other vessel.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-1-fn7" id="page-chapter-1-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the sun rose on Sunday 5 March 1797, the
                  <em>Duff</em> lay off Tahiti. The ship was visited by people
                  in canoes, intent on trading. Trade was refused, it being the
                  Holy day, although they remained on deck to observe a
                  religious service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following day, Captain Wilson landed with a number of
                  others and was taken by two Swedes who had been living on the
                  island for some years to see a large building at Point Venus
                  in Matavai Bay, built for Captain Bligh and known as ‘the
                  British House’. The missionary party returned again the
                  following day to take possession of the house and begin
                  preparing it for the 18 missionaries as well as their five
                  wives and two children who planned to make it their home. They
                  added sleeping compartments, a store room, medical clinic,
                  library and chapel.

                  painting. The presence of children in a painting depicting the
                  birth of a missionary endeavour anticipates the future. The
                  elder child seems to have his gaze directed beyond the frame
                  of the painting, with a finger pointing to something that
                  others do not yet see.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ha’amanamani, who had established a formal
                  <em>taiyo</em> exchange relationship with Captain Wilson, of a
                  kind that had become central to the connections of previous
                  European captains such as Cook, is said to have played a
                  prominent role in making these arrangements. He is shown in
                  the painting as a bearded man on the left of the painting in
                  the act of speaking, the object of Wilson’s attention.
                  Although a local priest at the neighbouring island of Mo’orea,
                  he squats in a shaft of light, suggestive of the influence of
                  God.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact, written accounts of the event on 16 March, depicted
                  by the painting, make it clear that Ha’amanamani had his own
                  agenda. Having been exiled from the island of Ra’iatea, he was
                  keen to use his relationship with Wilson to gain access to
                  firearms as well as equipment to fit out the European style
                  ship he was building to invade Ra’iatea. According to Mr
                  Bowell, the shopkeeper, a rope was stretched around the
                  British house on the day in question to keep the crowd of
                  Tahitians a suitable distance from the missionary party, with
                  Ha’amanamani the only Tahitian to cross the rope.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He evidently ‘sat in an odd posture, half bent upon his heels,
                  holding with one hand the rope, and frequently scratching his
                  head and rubbing his eyes with the other’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-1-fn9" id="page-chapter-1-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  While this posture is reflected in the painting, the rope is
                  hard to make out in reproductions, but possible to see when
                  standing in front of the painting itself. Ha’amanamani
                  evidently gave a long speech, describing the Gods and
                  important men of the surrounding islands, as well as the
                  European ships and captains that had visited them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ha’amanamani then declared that the missionaries could take
                  the house, trees, fruit and pigs they thought necessary at
                  Matavai, but asked for military support in his campaign to
                  retake Ra’iatea. When this was refused by Captian Wilson, he
                  negotiated for assistance in his shipbuilding efforts, as well
                  as a promise of diplomatic assistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The directors of the Missionary Society had issued
                  instructions to Captain Wilson in which they declared that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>As an inducement to us to prefer their island, they must
                      give us a full title to the land we may have occasion for,
                      guarantee to us the safety of our property from plunder,
                      the enjoyment of our laws and customs, and the undisturbed
                      exercise of our religion…</em>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>we recommend that the land shall not be purchased but
                      required, as the condition of us remaining with them: and
                      that the presents we make should not be considered as
                      payments, but as gratuities, the expressions and pledges
                      of our good will.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-1-fn10" id="page-chapter-1-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  A gift of grace clearly anticipated significant gifts in
                  return, but the thing that Ha’amanamani was most interested in
                  – European military might – troubled the missionary party.

                  This group, shown standing behind Mrs Hassell and the Wilsons,
                  is represented most clearly by the depiction of the carpenter
                  William Henry and his wife, who rather anxiously holds onto
                  his arm, near the front of the group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The missionaries are flanked on one side by Peter Haggerstein,
                  one of the Swedes, whose bare chest contrasts with the fuller
                  dress of the missionary party, but whose tattoos, described in
                  written accounts are hard to make out in the painting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On their other side the missionary party are framed by the
                  seated figure of Paitia, chief of Matavai. They find their
                  reflection in the group of Tahitians gathered behind
                  Ha’amanamani, representing potential converts. This group also
                  includes two children with their mother, the elder of whom
                  also looks, like the eldest Hassell child, beyond the frame of
                  the image, into the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the centre of the painting, in a seeming pool of darkness,
                  are two figures, covered from the neck down and sitting on the
                  shoulders of others. These are the young king, Tu (also known
                  as Pomare II), and his wife Tetua, both around 20 years old at
                  the time. The missionaries were reported to be surprised to
                  see them carried on land, but happy to bail their own canoes
                  on the water.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On either side of them are Pomare I and his wife, Itia, who
                  had engaged with Captain Cook and Captain Bligh, and were said
                  to have approved the grant of land at Matavai, when told of
                  the missionaries’ intentions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As I looked at the detail of tattoos on the legs of the
                  Tahitian crowd, revealed by the work of museum conservators, I
                  was tempted to see this widescreen image as a snapshot of the
                  meeting of missionaries and Polynesians in 1797. But I had to
                  remind myself of its artefactual nature.

                  It was after all a painting created in London by an artist who
                  hadn’t seen any of the events he depicted. It owes its setting
                  to the paintings of Hodges, but was also clearly influenced by
                  the ‘epic representations’ of Benjamin West, an American
                  artist and the official history painter to King George III,
                  who was made President of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1792.

                  His most famous work, <em>The Death of General Wolfe</em>,
                  exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1771, showed a crowd
                  arranged around the dying general at the Battle of Quebec in
                  1759. West’s depiction of a seated Native American is echoed

                  <em>The Cession of Matavai</em> is, however, much closer to
                  West’s subsequent painting,
                  <em>Penn’s Treaty with the Indians</em>, depicting a 1683
                  event when William Penn entered a peace treaty with Tamanend,
                  Chief of the Lenape. The painting was commissioned by Thomas
                  Penn, William’s son, who in 1737 used an unsigned and disputed
                  1686 deed to claim land extending as far West as a man could
                  walk in a day and a half – the so-called “Walking Purchase”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thomas Penn allegedly hired three men to run on a prepared
                  trail, one of whom managed to cover 70 miles. Displaced from
                  their land by this act of trickery, the Lenape allied with the
                  French and attacked Penn’s Creek in 1755, prompting Benjamin
                  Franklin to establish a militia in what had previously been a
                  pacifist Quaker settlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The image of a peaceful treaty and grant of land, painted
                  nearly 90 years later, was a piece of idealistic propaganda
                  that glossed the more complex history of exploitation,
                  expropriation and violence that followed this hopeful initial
                  moment.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-1-fn11" id="page-chapter-1-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Like <em>Penn’s Treaty with the Indians</em>, the
                  <em>Cession of Matavai</em> is a charter painting, depicting a
                  moment of Christian good faith, while at the same time staking
                  a claim to land, as well as a glorious imagined future. Unlike
                  West’s painting, it was made very soon after the events it
                  depicted. The <em>Duff</em> arrived home in July 1798, and by
                  the end of April 1799 <em>the Cession of Matavai</em> was on
                  display at the Royal Academy in London.

                  Looking back from our contemporary vantage point, two and a
                  quarter centuries in the future, we can ask how the future
                  that was anticipated by the painting actually unfolded. How do
                  we now remember British overseas missionary activity of the
                  nineteenth and twentieth centuries? How far and how quickly
                  did it depart from its early ideals?
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 6 March 1798, a year after the missionaries arrived, Tahiti
                  was visited by the Nautilus, a trading vessel from Macao.
                  Missionary efforts to prevent the Captain supplying weapons
                  and gunpowder to the Tahitians angered Tu, engaged in his own
                  campaign of expansion and conquest enabled by his access to
                  European weaponry. In fear of possible reprisals, most of the
                  missionaries, their wives and the children left Tahiti on the
                  Nautilus, bound for Port Jackson, as Sydney, Australia, was
                  known at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before the <em>Duff</em> arrived back in London, the Tahiti
                  mission had been reduced to a carpenter, a bricklayer, a
                  cooper, three ministers and a minister’s wife. In late 1798, a
                  second shipload of missionaries set sail for Tahiti in the
                  <em>Duff</em>, but the ship was captured by a French privateer
                  near Rio de Janeiro, and the crew and missionaries offloaded
                  at Montevideo, Uruguay.

                  from spring 1799 lists the painting as follows:

                      Society at Otaheite; and the ceremony of the formal grant
                      of the district of Matavai for their use, in presence of
                      the King, Queen, and Chiefs of that island, March 16.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-1-fn12" id="page-chapter-1-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Only in August 1799, after the Royal Academy exhibition had
                  closed, did news reach London that the majority of
                  missionaries had abandoned Tahiti, and it wasn’t until October
                  that the second group of missionaries managed to find their
                  way back to London from South America. By the end of the year,
                  one of the remaining ministers at Tahiti had died and the
                  cooper had left on another visiting ship.

                      officers and the missionaries [chiefly by W. Wilson]. And
                      illustrated with maps, charts, and views, drawn by Mr.
                      William Wilson, and engraved by the most eminent artists :
                      with a preliminary discourse on the geography and history
                      of the South Sea Islands, and an appendix, including
                      details never before published, of the natural and civil
                      state of Otaheite.</span>

                  Those missionaries that remained rapidly discovered that
                  although they had been allowed to stay and to eat food
                  produced at Matavai Bay, they were definitely not regarded as
                  owners of the land.

                  The mismatch between imagery, created in London, and reality,
                  experienced in Tahiti, could not have been starker as the
                  eighteenth century drew to a close. It was the century that
                  followed, however, that missionary activity would become
                  increasingly central to British understandings of, and
                  engagements with other parts of the world.

                  Images had featured at the front of monthly issues of this
                  periodical since its inauguration in 1793, but had generally
                  taken the form of miniature oval portraits of ministers,
                  theologians and occasionally missionaries.

                  With one exception, these had all been male, and with one
                  other notable exception, were all white Europeans: an
                  unclothed portrait of the young <em>Temoteitei</em> from the
                  Marquesas islands had been included in early 1800, following
                  his arrival in London the previous year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn2" id="page-chapter-2-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike earlier individual portraits, the stippled engraving
                  from 1804 includes four people: the Dutch missionary Johannes
                  Kicherer, preaching in profile with bible in hand, alongside
                  three Africans who direct their attention at him. The
                  “converted Hottentots”, as they were widely known at the time,
                  travelled to the Netherlands with Kicherer in early 1803,
                  visiting England at the end of the year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the concentration of ink and the detail falls on their
                  faces, their dress is lightly sketched to demonstrate it is
                  contemporary European in form. Clothing was an important
                  signifier of civilisation and conversion – the naked
                  <em>Temoteitei</em> had not converted – but the covered heads
                  of the two women suggest modesty and respectability. Indeed,
                  they present a significant contrast with the way that Saartje
                  Baartman was famously presented in London as the “Hottentot
                  Venus”, a mere seven years later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alongside clothing, names also had the power to signify
                  conversion. Mary, John and Martha – familiar Christian names –
                  are inscribed beneath the image. To contemporary evangelicals
                  these names would have recalled the episode in
                  <a href="#page-https-www-biblegateway-com-passage-search-luke-10-3a38-42-and-version-kjv" target="_blank">Luke’s Gospel (10: 38-42)</a>
                  when Martha busied herself with practical preparations to host
                  Jesus, while her sister Mary sat listening to his words.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tensions between Christ’s spiritual message and the
                  practical arrangements needed for its transmission dominated
                  early missionary work, so this choice of names was surely
                  deliberate. Indeed, it seems that in South Africa Mary had

                  One surviving copy of this image, published online by the
                  Ephemera Society, includes a hand-written pencil note that
                  states:

                  <em>The first converted Negroes. I saw them at Orange Street

                </p>
                <p>
                  The fact that the “converted Negroes” embodied respectable
                  family life further added to the way they were regarded – Mary
                  gave birth in Holland before returning to South Africa.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn5" id="page-chapter-2-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                  For missionary supporters, ‘the appearance of three converted
                  Hottentots’ in London offered ‘ocular proofs of the power of
                  Divine Grace on some of the most abject of the human race’,
                  suggesting not only that missionary activity was worth
                  supporting, but also that ‘Christianity is the most powerful
                  instrument of Civilization’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn6" id="page-chapter-2-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                  A religious tract under the title
                  <em>The Converted Hottentots</em>, published later in 1804,
                  reproduced a version of the same image with Kicherer excluded,
                  but the cheaper woodcut engraving method impacted on its
                  quality, making the converts’ facial features difficult to
                  make out in the smudges of ink.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tract included a transcribed dialogue with Kicherer and
                  the converts that took place on 21 November 1803 at the Scots
                  Church in London, originally published in the following
                  month’s <em>Evangelical Magazine</em>. It was chosen for
                  syndication because, according to the preface, it ‘gave the
                  highest satisfaction as to the truths of their conversion and
                  their sincere piety’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn7" id="page-chapter-2-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>

                <p>
                  But who were Mary, John and Martha and how did they come to be
                  celebrated alongside a Dutch missionary in the evangelical
                  publications of London?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Associated with <em>the Evangelical Magazine</em> from its
                  foundation, the Missionary Society began its own publishing
                  endeavours by producing annual reports. These were initially
                  very much along the lines of a commercial annual report – an
                  account of activity for shareholders, accompanied by a
                  statement of income and expenditure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Missionary shareholders were effectively members of the
                  society who subscribed at least a guinea a year, from whom the
                  board of Directors was elected. The Directors constituted a
                  monthly business meeting to supervise the work of the
                  society’s only salaried employee, the secretary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1803, however, a new publishing venture began,
                  <em>Transactions of the Missionary Society</em>, which made an
                  edited selection of the Society’s correspondence with
                  missionaries available in print – just over 500 pages were
                  included in volume one.

                  The first volume told the Society’s story from the
                  establishment in 1795 until the end of 1802. This was prefaced
                  by an introduction that connected this to a longer history of
                  missionary activity stretching back to ‘the great Apostle’,
                  Jesus Christ himself.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn8" id="page-chapter-2-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  The account acknowledged the conditions provided by the Roman
                  Empire for the missionary journeys of Paul, and readers were
                  expected to understand that the British Empire offered similar
                  opportunities. The expansion of Christianity alongside Spanish
                  and Portuguese empires was briefly described, though it was
                  made clear that Protestants would have done a better job.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, a brief summary was given of recent work by
                  Protestant missionaries: Danes in Greenland and India,
                  Moravians and the Dutch in various parts of the world, and
                  finally the English Baptists, with William Carey in India.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The focus for the <em>Transactions</em> then shifts to the
                  establishment of the Missionary Society in London and its
                  initial focus on the Pacific. The <em>Duff</em>’s capture on
                  its second voyage is described, as well as the abandonment of
                  Tahiti and the way this shook the endeavour ’to its
                  foundation’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn9" id="page-chapter-2-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  Regardless, missionary work in Tahiti continued, with a
                  reinforcement of eight missionaries arriving in July 1801.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The account was not confined to the Pacific but also described
                  early missionary efforts in Britain’s remaining North American
                  colonies, subsequently Canada, as well as missionary ambitions
                  for India. Besides the Pacific, the major focus of the
                  <em>Transactions</em> was the establishment of a second
                  missionary field in South Africa.

                  The Cape of Good Hope, on the tip of the African continent,
                  had been maintained as a refreshment station since 1652 by the
                  <em>Vereenigde Ost Indische Compagnie</em> (VOC), the Dutch
                  East India company, one of the world’s first global
                  corporations. The colony, originally centred around a VOC
                  castle, grew as increasing numbers of Europeans settled at the
                  Cape, taking ever larger tracts of land from its indigenous
                  Khoe and San inhabitants. Stock and crops were raised with
                  forced labour, including that of people enslaved at
                  Madagascar, Mozambique, as well as Dutch colonies in Asia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rivals with the British in the mid-seventeenth century, the
                  Dutch had become allies after 1688 when the Glorious
                  Revolution put William of Orange, a Dutch Protestant King, on
                  the English throne. The eighteenth century saw the British
                  overtake the Dutch in wealth and maritime supremacy, but in
                  1780 Dutch support for American rebels led to conflict with
                  Britain that weakened the Dutch Republic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In early 1795 an alliance of French forces and Dutch
                  Republicans invaded the Netherlands to establish the Batavian
                  Republic, allied with revolutionary France. Britain, then at
                  war with France, invaded the Cape in mid-1795 to protect its
                  shipping routes, at around the same time the Missionary
                  Society was established back in London.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <em>Transactions</em> noted that the Society’s earliest
                  missionaries to Africa went to Sierra Leone in 1797, but war
                  kept them on the coast, where by mid-1798 one had died and the
                  other had been dismissed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although British evangelicals connected West Africa with the
                  evils of the slave trade, they also regarded British control
                  of the Cape as an act of providence that might open the
                  continent to Christianity by another route. The problem was
                  that most people in the Cape colony spoke Dutch, making it a
                  difficult place for British missionaries to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This problem appeared to solve itself when the Directors
                  received a letter in early 1797 from Johannes Theodosius Van
                  der Kemp, who heard about the establishment of the Society and
                  wanted to volunteer. Van der Kemp was a fifty-year-old
                  Edinburgh trained medic and experienced soldier who had become
                  an evangelical Christian after losing his wife and daughter,
                  and nearly losing his own life in a boating accident in 1791.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like Captain Wilson before him, Van der Kemp was regarded as
                  sent by God. Working with the Directors, he established the
                  Netherlands Missionary Society in Rotterdam, recruiting
                  another volunteer for mission work, Johannes Kicherer, then in
                  his early twenties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of 1798 the two Dutchmen, accompanied by two
                  Englishmen, John Edmonds and William Edwards, departed on the
                  <a href="#page-https-www-freesettlerorfelon-com-convict-ship-hillsborough-htm" target="_blank"><em>Hillsborough</em></a>, a convict ship bound for Botany Bay, part of the same

                  The arrival of these missionaries at the Cape, and the support
                  offered by the British acting governor, General Francis
                  Dundas, generated a reaction among local Christians that led
                  to the formation of the South African Missionary Society.

                <p>
                  While they were in Cape Town, however, the missionaries met
                  three men who literally changed the direction of missionary
                  activity in South Africa. They are reported in the
                  <em>Transactions</em> as ‘Boscheman Captains’ by the names of
                  ‘Vigilant’ and ‘Slaporm’ (slack-arm) and ‘Orlam’ (a term used
                  to describe creole people of indigenous descent, of whom he
                  seems to have been one).

                  When they asked for some ‘good persons’ to ‘be sent among
                  them’ this was interpreted as another act of divine providence
                  and although Van der Kemp felt called to the Cape Colony’s
                  eastern frontier, he agreed that William Edwards should go

                  The historian Nigel Penn has called the eighteenth century
                  northern border zone with the Cape
                  <a href="#page-https-books-google-co-uk-books-about-the-forgotten-frontier-html-id-gx2qtfskmmc-and-redir-esc-y" target="_blank">the ‘Forgotten Frontier’</a>. In contrast to regular pitched battles fought in the east
                  of the Cape Colony, this porous frontier with its highly
                  mobile population of indigenous Khoe and San made the
                  expansion of European domination different, but no less
                  violent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The central institution of this expanding frontier was the
                  commando, an armed band of farmers of Dutch descent,
                  accompanied by their Khoe servants, who assembled for mutual
                  self-defence. The commando had a great deal in common with
                  what became the ‘posse’ in the American West later in the
                  century, and then as now, when groups of armed and frightened
                  men rode out seeking justice, seemingly defensive actions
                  frequently became offensive actions.

                  While the Cape’s cattle and sheep-herding Khoe peoples had
                  much in common with the similarly pastoralist Dutch frontier
                  farmers, known as <em>trekboers</em>, the San (a Khoe term
                  meaning forager) or as they were widely known in the colony
                  ‘Bushmen’, pursued a way of life that depended predominantly
                  on wild foods. This put them into conflict with the new
                  arrivals, whose stock consumed the limited supply of water and
                  grass on which wild animals also depended. In addition, and
                  perhaps more significantly, large numbers of these wild
                  animals were killed by the guns of horse-riding incomers.

                  To resist these depredations, San, armed with bows and
                  poisoned arrows, raided pastoralist herds, prompting deadly
                  and frequently indiscriminate commandos against them. Men were
                  shot on sight and women and children taken to farms where they
                  were forced to work. When John Barrow was sent by the newly
                  installed British Governor, George Macartney, to investigate
                  in 1797, he was shocked to hear farmers boast of having killed
                  hundreds of San.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn12" id="page-chapter-2-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was a genocidal conflict over the land, and for the San,
                  literally a fight for survival.

                  The ‘Boscheman Captains’ who met the missionaries in Cape Town
                  came from beyond the Roggeveld, an area where the land rises
                  to meet the high plateau of the African interior, and rain
                  only falls during the summer – an arid zone known at the time
                  as ‘Bushmanland’. The arrival of trekboers in the region
                  during the second half of the eighteenth century initiated a
                  cycle of violence that saw many hundreds of people killed by
                  commandos and hundreds more taken captive.

                  In 1798 Floris Visser, a magistrate and farmer, more pious
                  than most, travelled to Stellenbosch to propose a different
                  way of dealing with the San. This so impressed the authorities
                  that he was sent to meet the Governor in Cape Town, who agreed
                  to his proposals. Livestock would be given to them, along with
                  rights to land where they and their children would be safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The idea was that instead of being opposed to colonial
                  expansion, the San should, through the acquisition of
                  property, become part of its pastoral economy, hastening their
                  ‘civilisation’. Macartney encouraged Visser to send San
                  leaders to Cape Town to meet him, where he presumably intended
                  to charm them into cooperating.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Visser had proposed that ‘captains’ be appointed among the San
                  and given a copper headed staff and brass gorget as a sign of
                  their status – an early method of indirect rule that was
                  partially successful among Khoe groups in the Colony.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the ongoing issues that exacerbated the conflict was
                  that it was very hard to identify recognised leaders with whom
                  to negotiate. The egalitarian nature of San society made it
                  hard for anyone to put themselves forward and receive
                  consistent support from their communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In early 1799, despite the departure of Governor Macartney on
                  health grounds, Visser recruited 187 San men and 284 women and
                  children who were prepared to agree to his proposals,
                  including a number willing to work on Dutch farms, in part
                  because they were literally starving.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>T’Karoe, T’abekom</em> and <em>T’zijib</em> agreed to go
                  to Cape Town following a presentation of gifts that included
                  livestock, beads, knives, tobacco, mirrors, flints and
                  tinder-boxes. According to Van der Kemp, they had been
                  interested by Visser’s prayers and hymns, and wanted to know
                  more about the settlers’ God. It is likely that they had also
                  heard about the Moravian mission at Bavian’s Kloof (now
                  Genadendaal) which had been reestablished in 1792 and was
                  rapidly becoming a refuge for dispossessed Khoe within the
                  colony.

                  Without explaining any of this background, the
                  <em>Transactions</em> picked up the story with the
                  missionaries travelling to the inland settlement of Roodezand,
                  guided by Bruntjie, a Khoe elephant hunter from Baviaan’s
                  Kloof. From there, Van der Kemp and Edmonds travelled to the
                  East in their wagon with Bruntjie, while Kicherer and Edwards
                  waited for a promised wagon to take them to ‘Bushmanland’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They managed to recruit a local man of Dutch descent by the
                  name of Kramer, as well as Willem Fortuin, of mixed Khoe
                  descent, as well as his wife who spoke ‘the Boschemen’s
                  language’, to join them later – the
                  <em>Transactions</em> declared that ‘so mercifully the Lord
                  seemed preparing their way unto the Gentiles’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn13" id="page-chapter-2-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  From Roodezand, the missionaries travelled for a week to
                  Visser’s farm, and from there another two weeks into
                  ‘Bushmanland’, accompanied by five wagons, 60 oxen, 200 sheep
                  and around 50 people. There they established a small
                  missionary settlement at what they named
                  <em>Blydevooruitzigt Fontein</em>, which the
                  <em>Transactions</em> translated as Happy Prospects Fountain.
                  Its two springs gave it the potential for permanent
                  settlement, including a garden planned to recall a plentiful
                  Eden in the midst of this arid land.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the farmers left, Visser’s son stayed to help and his
                  knowledge of |Xam, the language spoken by the local San, was
                  invaluable until Fortuin and his wife arrived. Other
                  linguistic tensions plagued the mission however, and when San
                  joined the settlement, they were divided into two groups – one
                  to learn English with Edwards and the other Dutch with
                  Kicherer. Not long afterwards Edwards took his ‘English’
                  congregation to live separately.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By November 1799, Kicherer reported in a letter quoted in the
                  <em>Transactions</em> that they had between 30 and 40
                  ‘Bushmen’ living at the mission, although he noted in a
                  slightly exasperated tone that numbers had been higher, but
                  ‘they wander to and fro’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn14" id="page-chapter-2-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While there were signs of interest in Christianity among the
                  San, Kicherer worried that many residents at the mission were
                  more focused on his regular gifts of tobacco – a quarter pipe
                  after attending each service.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn15" id="page-chapter-2-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Concerned about rapidly depleting supplies, Kicherer took nine
                  San to Cape Town in January 1800 to ask for additional support
                  from the Governor.

                  His letter to the Directors following his return in March
                  suggests he was deeply conflicted, seeking to convince himself
                  he was doing God’s work among ‘the most savage and ferocious
                  of all the people who are known in this country’, but
                  constantly worrying about the meagre and extremely insecure
                  practical arrangements on which his mission depended.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn16" id="page-chapter-2-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  He described his ‘separation from civilised society’ and the
                  distance from his family and friends as ‘an open wound that
                  grows every day.’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn17" id="page-chapter-2-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>

                <p>
                  As a relatively young man of , he was strongly tempted to
                  accept the offer of a post as minister to one of the settler
                  communities in the colony. In addition, while Kicherer had
                  been in the Cape, ‘Vigilant’, having killed ‘Orlam’ in a
                  fight, attempted to help himself to the mission’s sheep.

                  cloak, between the quarrelling men, saving his life. Despite
                  his apparent initial enthusiasm for the missionaries,
                  ‘Vigilant’ later told a local farmer who arrested him that he

                  recruit and a stronger mandate from the Governor, Edwards left
                  to try his luck with Van der Kemp in the East of the Colony.
                  When a group of San attempted to shoot Kicherer with poisoned
                  arrows, he decided to relocate the mission to the Zak River,
                  nearer the Colony, where he might receive greater protection
                  from the colonists.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this point, the so-called ‘Bushman Mission’ seems to have
                  shifted its focus from the San to people of Khoe descent, many
                  of whom had lived and worked on Dutch farms and were more
                  interested in becoming Christians.<br>
                  At the end of 1800 additional missionary recruits arrived in
                  South Africa and one of them, William Anderson joined Kicherer
                  when he was once again visiting Cape Town.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In May 1801, less than two years after commencing the mission,
                  Kicherer led his followers across Bushmanland to the less arid
                  region near the Gariep, or ‘great river’ in the North, where
                  Anderson had gone ahead to establish a mission to the Coranna,
                  or Orlam, a Khoe group that had left the colony.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is with a letter from William Anderson dated 6 December
                  1801 describing this seeming abandonment of the mission to the
                  San that the first volume of <em>Transactions</em> ends its
                  account of work on the northern frontier of the Cape Colony,
                  although quite a bit of space was also given to Van der Kemp’s
                  attempts to establish a mission among Xhosa-speakers further
                  East.

                  page of its second volume, published in 1804, announced in
                  capital letters that it included The Rev. Mr. Kicherer’s
                  <em>Narrative of His Mission to the Hottentots and
                    Boschemen</em>.

                <p>
                  In March 1802, Kicherer had returned to ‘Bushmanland’ from the
                  North, only to have his stock raided and to find venomous
                  snake heads floating in the waterholes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After reestablishing his former base at the Zak river,
                  increasing numbers of Khoe arrived at the mission, and by
                  January 1803 when he left his posting once more, there were
                  600 people living there, of whom 30 adults and 50 children had
                  been baptised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ever restless Kicherer, concerned about his own health as
                  well as that of his recently widowed mother, left the Cape for
                  Europe at the very moment the Colony returned to Dutch control
                  following the Treaty of Amiens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  News of Kicherer’s arrival in Holland with ‘three African
                  converts’ was reported in the
                  <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> and their arrival in London
                  anxiously awaited, despite reservations from the Society’s
                  Directors, presumably concerned at the cost of hosting
                  them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn18" id="page-chapter-2-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Having witnessed responses to the San he had taken to Cape
                  Town, Kicherer’s commitment to take converts to Europe seems
                  to have been a fairly knowing part of his ongoing campaign to
                  attract additional resources for the mission.

                <p>
                  According to a preface in the <em>Transactions</em>, Mary,
                  John and Martha’s desire to go to Europe was prompted by
                  allegations made within the colony that the religion they were
                  taught by missionaries was not the same as that of European
                  Christians.

                  The celebrity status their presence provided Kicherer,
                  however, induced the Directors to ask him to write an account,
                  to literally put his name on the front page of their magazine
                  and to commission an image of the Zak River mission based on
                  his sketch. Kicherer became the hero of the story and while
                  his account may not have exactly glorified his missionary work
                  in South Africa over the previous four years, it certainly
                  cast it in the best possible light for European readers.

                  The story told by Kicherer was full of accounts of sincere
                  conversion, but at the same time constructed a portrait of the
                  San as ‘Wild Hottentots’ emphasising the difficulty of
                  conducting missionary work among them, in contrast to the
                  ‘Tame Hottentots’ of the colony. The visual distinction in his
                  sketch map between the rectilinear houses of the ‘Baptised
                  Hottentots’ and the circular structures of the ‘unbaptised
                  Hottentots’ make a similar categorical distinction based on
                  conversion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kicherer compared San huts to pig styes and found their
                  practice of smearing animal fat and pigment onto their bodies
                  disgusting. He was shocked by examples of domestic violence
                  and infanticide, and his descriptions of the degradation of
                  the San provided a backdrop for the ‘Providence of God’ which
                  called them to the fellowship of the Gospel and rendered them
                  ‘the distinguished trophies of his almighty grace’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn19" id="page-chapter-2-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>In religious terms, Kicherer suggested that the San:</p>
                <p>
                  <em>have no idea whatever of the Supreme Being… practice no
                    kind of worship’ having only ‘a superstitious reverence of a
                    little insect known by the name the Creeping-leaf, a sight
                    of which, they conceive, indicates something fortunate, and
                    to kill it, they suppose, will bring a curse upon the
                    perpetrator.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  An 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum would quote
                  Kicherer’s words in its caption for a praying mantis that was
                  displayed there as ‘the Hottentot’s God’, a name retained in
                  contemporary Afrikaans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This detail, as well as Kicherer’s account of healing
                  ceremonies involving ‘men… employed to blow, and make a
                  humming over the sick, which they sometimes continue for many
                  hours together’ fits well with later descriptions of San
                  ceremonial practices across southern Africa. Kicherer,
                  however, found these impossible to reconcile with what he
                  regarded as ‘civilisation’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn20" id="page-chapter-2-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We can’t know what San made of the Christianity he attempted
                  to teach them, although he noted that those who visited Cape
                  Town compared its Calvinist Church to an ant’s nest and its
                  organ to the sound of a swarm of bees.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within Kicherer’s account there are, however, hints of the
                  endemic murderous violence of the Frontier. He suggested that
                  ‘Boschemen… when approaching a white man for the first time…
                  appear in an agony of fear, which discovers itself by the
                  trembling of every limb.’
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn21" id="page-chapter-2-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those who travelled to Cape Town were struck with dread and
                  dismay when they saw men hung in chains for atrocious crimes,
                  as well as when they witnessed a public execution, although
                  Kicherer attempted to make these things object lessons in
                  European justice as an ordinance of God.

                  Naming and clothing emerge as central themes in Kicherer’s
                  account. He describes how he gave names to the San who joined
                  the mission, and wrote these across their shoulders in chalk.
                  When they approached him, the first thing they did was turn to
                  show him their backs. His regular trips to the Cape seem to
                  have been motivated, at least partly, by attempts to get hold
                  of European style clothes to dress his congregation, to
                  replace the sheep skins he described as ‘filthy karosses’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An account of Kicherer’s testimony to a congregation in London
                  in November 1803 makes it clear that the ‘Hottentot converts’
                  were intended to illustrate a contrast with the way in which
                  they were reported to have lived before conversion:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>When these poor Africans are enlightened, a great change
                      takes place in their outward conduct and appearance. Those
                      who before were almost naked, clothe themselves with
                      decency; – from being extremely filthy, they learn to be
                      clean; – and from that laziness which prevailed among them
                      while Heathens, they learn to be diligent, and to
                      cultivate the earth for their subsistence. Thus while the
                      gospel brings to them a spiritual salvation, it becomes
                      also the means of civilising, we might almost say, of
                      humanising them; and this affords an additional argument
                      for Missionary zeal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn22" id="page-chapter-2-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup></em>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  When questioned in front of a congregation with Kicherer
                  acting as translator and mediator, there were few in London
                  who doubted the sincerity of Martha, Mary and John’s
                  conversion and their conviction in the saving grace of Christ.
                  However, there seems to have been a degree of slight of hand
                  in their presentation as the straightforward results of
                  missionary work, alongside these accounts of ‘wild Bushmen’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While John van Rooij called himself a ‘pure Hottentot’, both
                  Mary, whose maiden name was Fortuin, and Martha Arendse were
                  regarded in the Cape as ‘Bastaard-Hottentots’, the children of
                  one Khoe parent and one enslaved Malay parent. Mary had worked
                  at the tobacco plantation where Kicherer bought his tobacco,
                  and left this employment to join the mission. Martha had
                  worked as a servant for a Dutch family, but left to join the
                  mission where she was employed by Kicherer as his
                  house-keeper.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Familiar with the social distinctions established within the
                  Colony over the previous century and a half, all three would
                  have recognised that being Christian, as well as promising
                  other-worldly salvation, enhanced one’s status in this world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were many in the colony who were extremely suspicious of
                  Kicherer’s missionary work, with its emphasis on salvation and
                  education – a view that reasserted itself when the Cape
                  returned to Dutch control in 1803. Martin Hinrich Lichtenstein
                  was a young German doctor and naturalist who arrived at the
                  Cape with General Janssens, the governor appointed by the the
                  Batavian Republic.

                <p>
                  In mid-1805 Lichtenstein was sent to investigate the
                  conditions in Bushmanland and visited Kicherer’s mission at
                  Zak river, of which he noted ‘so much boasting has been made
                  by himself and his friends in Europe’ – an image of the
                  settlement was made for the English edition of Lichtenstein’s
                  account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lichtenstein suggested that both Kicherer and Van der Kemp
                  ‘seemed wholly to forget that mankind was destined to work as
                  well as to pray’. In Kicherer’s absence those remaining at the
                  mission had become dejected, and he claimed were generally
                  ‘Bastard-Hottentots: several of them were entirely white; and
                  the greater part had been baptised before they came hither;
                  some were even born of christian parents’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lichtenstein went as far as to claim that Mary, Martha and
                  John had been baptised at Cape Town by a preacher called Fleck
                  long before they even met Kicherer. While acknowledging that
                  people at the mission had been instructed in Christianity,
                  Lichtenstein asserted that ‘the fact is, that they would have
                  been much better employed in the service of the colonists,
                  providing for their wants by industry, than pursuing, as they
                  did here, lives wholly useless, and abandoned to sloth’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-2-fn23" id="page-chapter-2-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When Kicherer arrived back at the Cape in early 1805, Governor
                  Janssens proclaimed a new policy: missions could be
                  established beyond the boundaries of the colony, but must have
                  no communication with its inhabitants, who were prohibited
                  from attending missionary schools. Missionaries were
                  specifically prohibited from recruiting anyone from the
                  service of their masters – no one working for a colonist or
                  who had worked for a colonist in the past year could join a
                  mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the boundaries of the colony redrawn to include both
                  Kicherer and Van der Kemp’s missions, it was declared that
                  these could remain, but were prohibited from teaching writing.
                  Instead they were encouraged to concentrate on training people
                  to cultivate the land. Finally, missionary settlements were
                  only allowed to offer prayers for the Batavian Republic and
                  the Cape Colony.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Returning to the Zak River in October 1805, Kicherer found the
                  river had dried up and the mission’s main supporter among the
                  farmers, Floris Visser, had died. A San raid carried off 200
                  sheep the following month, prompting the newly married
                  Kicherer to conclude that he was, after all, called to become
                  a Government appointed minister in the colonial town of
                  Graaff-Reinet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1806, less than three years after Mary, John and Martha
                  visited London, and just as the British resumed their control
                  of the Cape, the Zak River Mission was abandoned.

                  The title of this chapter comes from a&nbsp;catalogue of the
                  Missionary Museum, printed in 1826 and preserved in the
                  British Library. The museum opened in 1815 and a visitor in
                  1819 recalled a ‘very fine cameleopard’, suggesting the
                  giraffe was a feature of the museum from its earliest
                  days.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn1" id="page-chapter-3-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Images of the museum from the 1840s and 1850s, such as that
                  above, have the giraffe at their centre, its head reaching
                  into the space of an overhead skylight. An immobile spectre,
                  this towering creature dominated the museum across three
                  locations and nearly fifty years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But how did it come to occupy this imposing position, and who
                  was ultimately responsible for its killing, preservation and
                  transportation to Europe?
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 24 June 1812, the Rev. John Campbell, a forty-six-year-old
                  Congregational Minister from Scotland, boarded the
                  <em>Isabella</em> convict transport ship at Gravesend in Kent,
                  bound for Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Formerly an ironmonger in Edinburgh, Campbell had been
                  interested in Africa for decades. He had campaigned for the
                  abolition of the slave trade, and was a friend of John Newton,
                  the former slave trader who penned the hymnn&nbsp;<em>Amazing Grace</em>
                  in 1772.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Campbell had been the motivating force behind the&nbsp;<em>Society for the Education of Africans</em>, hoping that schooling in Britain might convert young
                  Africans through Grace and the Gospel, enabling them to return
                  and transform their home countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Leading Anglicans feared the impact of an Edinburgh education,
                  resolving in 1799 that the 20 boys and four girls sent from
                  Sierra Leone ‘should remain in safety from contamination with
                  any heretical or socialistic ideals’,&nbsp;at an&nbsp;<em>African Academy</em>&nbsp;in Clapham, London.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn2" id="page-chapter-3-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ordained the minister of Kingsland Chapel in London in early
                  1804, Campbell met&nbsp;<a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-2-the-revd-mr-kicherer-mary-john-and-martha" target="_blank">Martha, Mary and John, the South African visitors</a>, shortly after they arrived with Rev.

                  Although he had never been to the continent of Africa,
                  Campbell had experience of preaching tours across the
                  highlands and islands of Scotland, as well as the north of
                  England.

                <p>
                  Campbell was asked to visit the Cape by the Directors of the
                  Missionary Society, following the death of Johannes van der
                  Kemp at the end of 1811. Van der Kemp had been in the process
                  of preparing to launch a mission to Madagascar, where his very
                  young formerly enslaved wife originally came from.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The missionaries’ advocacy for the indigenous Khoisan people
                  of the Cape, and the attention they had drawn to their abusive
                  treatment by local farmers, had come to a head, and the Cape
                  government was in the process of launching a commission to
                  investigate their charges.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn3" id="page-chapter-3-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is more, Hinrich Lichtenstein had just published the
                  English translation of his&nbsp;<em>Travels in Southern Africa between the years 1803 and
                    1806</em>, which included extremely unflattering descriptions of both
                  van der Kemp and his missionary settlement Bethelsdorp.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This reflected suspicion among the settlers of what they
                  called&nbsp;<em>Bedelaarsdorp</em>&nbsp;(Beggar’s village), partly due
                  to the reluctance of its residents to labour on local farms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lichtenstein ridiculed both Van der Kemp’s adoption of local
                  forms of dress, such as leather sandals, and questioned the
                  marriages of both Van der Kemp and his fellow Bethelsdorp
                  missionary, James Read, to extremely young non-white
                  women.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn4" id="page-chapter-3-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Campbell was tasked with visiting the mission stations in
                  Africa to investigate. He was also asked:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>… to establish such regulations… as might be most
                      conducive to the attainment of the great end proposed –
                      the conversion of the heathen, keeping in view at the same
                      time the promotion of their civilization.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn5" id="page-chapter-3-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup></em>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Arriving at Cape Town after four months at sea, Campbell met
                  friends including Kicherer, who had been minister of the Dutch
                  Reformed Church at Graaf-Reinet since his return to South
                  Africa. The Cape Colony had returned to British control in
                  1806 following a naval invasion during the Napoleonic wars, so
                  Britain’s 1807 Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade
                  applied there, at least in theory. Slavery, but also the trade
                  in enslaved people, continued to operate however, and Campbell
                  witnessed domestic slavery first hand at the Cape.

                  While he was at Cape Town, a ship carrying captives from
                  Madagascar and Mozambique was seized and each captive was
                  apprenticed to a Cape master for 14 years, during which they
                  were supposed to learn a trade, to read and the principles of
                  Christianity. While decrying slavery as ‘a condition which
                  shocks human nature’ and calling the prohibition on marriage
                  by the enslaved ‘not only an act of great injustice… but a
                  heinous sin against God’, Campbell felt that the ‘temporary
                  captivity’ of apprentices might prove a blessing to their home
                  countries, if they ever returned there.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn6" id="page-chapter-3-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                  Campbell’s first visits beyond Cape Town were to the Moravian
                  missions of Groenekloef (now Mamre, established in 1808), and
                  Genadendal (the place of Grace), South Africa’s earliest
                  Christian mission. Established in 1738, it was abandoned for
                  fifty years before being re-established in 1792.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Campbell visited the homes of the indigenous
                  Khoekhoen&nbsp;families living at these missions, remarking on
                  their cleanliness as well as their ‘mostly decent’ dress,
                  while noticing that some still dressed in loose
                  sheepskins.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn7" id="page-chapter-3-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>&nbsp;Echoing Lichtenstein’s description of the orderliness of
                  these settlements, he nevertheless wrote down frightful
                  stories about encounters with African animals, including a
                  leopard attack.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was not until mid-February 1813 that Campbell set off to
                  inspect the Society’s own mission stations, going first to
                  Bethelsdorp at Algoa Bay in the eastern Cape, Van der Kemp’s
                  mission since 1803.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Travelling from Cape Town with two wagons, drawn by teams of
                  twelve and fourteen oxen, Campbell was almost entirely reliant
                  on the expertise and know-how of his Khoekhoen guides.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The party was overseen by Cupido Kakkerlak (Cupid Cockroach in
                  Afrikaans), who Campbell called the group’s ‘travelling
                  director’,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-3-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  a Khoe preacher from Bethelsdorp who had been baptised by Van
                  der Kemp in 1801.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn9" id="page-chapter-3-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition ‘Britannia’, a Gonaqua man, drove the other wagon,
                  while ‘John’ and ‘Michael’ led the oxen and ‘Elizabeth’ and
                  ‘Sarah’ took care of cooking, washing, finding water as well
                  as making regular coffees for the travelling party.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the month-long journey, Campbell formed an attachment
                  to his companions, writing that they were:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>far from being so barbarous a race as they are usually

                  The mission at Bethelsdorp was a rare place where Khoekhoen
                  could live a fairly independent life within the colony, apart
                  from when pressed to serve in the Cape Regiment – the majority
                  of Khoekhoe not living at missions were forced to work as farm
                  labourers. Vocational training seems to have been a strand at
                  the mission, and William Corner, a Black missionary from
                  Demerara, a Dutch colony in the Caribbean, had been training
                  carpentry apprentices for around a year when Campbell arrived.

                  amaNtinde lineage, who would go on to play a key role in the
                  expansion of Christianity in South Africa. Tzatzoe presented
                  Campbell with a wooden box he had made in the cabinet maker’s
                  style ‘for containing any varieties I might happen to obtain
                  higher up in Africa’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn11" id="page-chapter-3-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>

                  Campbell was definitely not as impressed by the physical
                  appearance of Bethelsdorp as he had been by Genadendal – he
                  compared its irregularity to Norwich or Manchester – some
                  houses having been abandoned. The lack of water supply also
                  meant there weren’t any trees or gardens. He was equally
                  unimpressed by the fact that many people still dressed in
                  animal skins, but blamed Van der Kemp, suggesting he ‘seems to
                  have judged it necessary, rather to imitate the savage in
                  appearance, than to induce the savage to imitate him’! ⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn12" id="page-chapter-3-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>

                  Visiting farms a mile and a half away, however, Campbell was
                  impressed by the amount of cultivated land and when describing
                  the Bethelsdorp cattle herd, stated that he had never seen so
                  many beasts in one place apart from at Smithfield Market in
                  London.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cupido, who had been born around 1760, grew up on a farm and
                  did his time as a farm labourer. However, he became a key
                  figure among the founders of Betheldorp, when land had been
                  allocated for the mission by Batavian authorities in 1803-4.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Bethelsdorp, Cupido worked for himself as a sawyer and wood
                  trader, while his wife made soap for sale. Together they built
                  up a herd of ten oxen and purchased a wagon. The church became
                  increasingly important in Cupido’s life, and he was one of the
                  first people at the mission to learn to read and write.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While he thought there was still room for improvement,
                  Campbell concluded that during its first decade Bethelsdorp
                  had become a self-sustaining Christian community of around a
                  thousand people, with over two thousand cattle. A significant
                  measure of this, in Campbell’s eyes, was the money they raised
                  to support the poor and sick, as well as missionary work
                  elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From Bethelsdorp, a party of five wagons set off in April
                  1813, intent on examining potential mission sites in Albany,
                  recently cleared of its human inhabitants by a combination of
                  Khoekhoen and British troops during the fourth frontier war of
                  1811-12. It was while travelling through this recently
                  depopulated landscape that Campbell first encountered large
                  African mammals such as elephants and buffaloes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was the 30 Khoekhoen in the party, however, including two
                  who had originally been part of the Zak River mission [<a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-2-the-revd-mr-kicherer-mary-john-and-martha" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>], who did all the hunting, at times mounted on oxen. They
                  skinned and cut up animals to make biltong (preserved meat)
                  and presented Campbell with various trophies, including the
                  horns of the first buffalo they shot. Somewhere along the way,
                  Campbell seems to have acquired his own sheepskin cloak or
                  kaross, which he appreciated on cold nights.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arriving at Graaf-Reinet at the end of April, Campbell met&nbsp;<a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-2-the-revd-mr-kicherer-mary-john-and-martha" target="_blank">Kicherer, Martha, Mary and John</a>, but also William Burchell, a young botanist and collector

                  1811 and April 1815.

                  Writing to his mother, just before he set off from Cape Town,
                  Burchell declared:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>I do not consider myself out of the way of making money,
                      when I think of the value of what I shall be able to
                      obtain in my journey. I have been informed that a skin of
                      the Camelopard which was shot in that country where I am
                      going to, was sold in England for fifteen hundred pounds
                      and though I cannot hope that if I bring one home it will
                      sell for half that sum, yet should I be so fortunate as to
                      discover the Unicorn, which has been supposed to exist in
                      this part of Africa, I have not the least doubt of making
                      five times that sum.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn13" id="page-chapter-3-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup></em>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Discussed in the same breath as the unicorn, the giraffe had
                  until recently been considered a quasi-mythical beast in
                  Europe, known from Classical texts that described it as
                  camel-like with the skin markings of a leopard – hence
                  camel-leopard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first skin and skeleton to arrive in England had been
                  collected at the Cape in the late 1770s by William Paterson,
                  another Scotsman, and was presented by his patron Lady
                  Strathmore to John Hunter, whose anatomy collections became
                  the Hunterian Museum at London’s Royal College of
                  Surgeons.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-3-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  At around the same time, Robert Jacob Gordon, a Dutch born
                  soldier from the Scotch brigade, sent a giraffe skin to
                  Holland, and a few years later the French traveller François
                  Le Vaillant sent another to Paris that ended up in the Natural
                  History Museum in Paris.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Burchell had initially travelled into the interior from Cape
                  Town with missionaries, using the Society’s stations as the
                  stopping points on his journey. Like Campbell, he was
                  dependent on Khoekhoen guides and key among them was Stoffel
                  Speelman, recently discharged from the Cape Regiment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-3-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like Cupido, Speelman took charge of the practical aspects of
                  the journey, finding water for the cattle and doing most of
                  the hunting – for food as well as Natural History collecting.
                  Burchell trained his assistants to cut and remove skins in a
                  way that would enable subsequent taxidermy. In a journal
                  entry, Burchell stated that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>In order to encourage Speelman in being diligent to shoot
                      birds for my collection I have promised him a rix dollar
                      for every dozen skins I preserve: And to whoever shall
                      bring down a camelopardalis, any thing of my bartering
                      goods he may choose.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn16" id="page-chapter-3-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup></em>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Burchell and Speelman twice made the dangerous journey on the
                  route they pioneered between Graaf Reinet and Klaarwater,
                  across so-called ‘Bushmanland’, and Campbell intended to
                  follow in their footsteps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Graaf-Reinet, Burchell advised Campbell, but also agreed
                  that one of his party could join them as a guide. How much
                  they discussed Natural History collecting is unclear, but
                  Burchell’s wagons must have already been impressively full,
                  since he collected a total of 63,000 items during his
                  travels.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-3-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Campbell’s party of three wagons and numerous livestock and
                  dogs completed this journey in early June 1813 when they
                  crossed what he called the ‘Great River’, later known as the
                  Orange, and now mostly called the Gariep, a transliteration of
                  the Khoe words Kai !Garib, meaning ‘great river’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Campbell’s published account of the journey describes them
                  entering what he called ‘Griqualand’, but at the time was no
                  such thing. The people they were on their way to see called
                  themselves ‘Bastaard Hottentoten’ or just plain ‘Bastaards’,
                  in acknowledgement of their mixed ancestry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During his visit, Campbell persuaded them to abandon this term
                  on account of ‘the offensiveness of the word to an English or
                  Dutch ear’, and to rename themselves Griqua, since the
                  Khoekhoen group they were most descended from was the
                  ‘Gurigriqua’. They also renamed Klaarwater (Clear Water),
                  their main settlement, Griqua Town – now mostly known as
                  Griekwastad.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-3-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The settlement was dominated at the time by the Kok and
                  Barends families, fugitives from the expanding Cape Colony,
                  who prospered by trading and raiding across the frontier. The
                  advantages that guns and horses gave them over other residents
                  of the African interior were considerable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A mission had been established at Kok’s kraal in 1802, but
                  relocated along with the people to Klaarwater shortly
                  afterwards. By 1813 Campbell recorded a population of around
                  1300 Griquas, with another 1300 Corannas (another mixed
                  Khoekhoen group) under their protection.

                <p>
                  Campbell published an image of ‘Griquatown’ in his book, but
                  this had considerably more artistic merit than most of the
                  other images, such as that of Bethelsdorp above, which were
                  based on his own generally perspective-less sketches. The
                  image derived from a drawing made by none other than William
                  Burchell, who had given it to William Anderson. Anderson was a
                  missionary of the Society who had worked in the region since
                  1801.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Burchell was extremely surprised and somewhat upset when he
                  finally arrived back in Cape Town in 1815 and found that the
                  drawing had not only been sent to England, but that it had
                  found its way into Campbell’s account as a print, with no
                  acknowledgment of its original source.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-3-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>&nbsp;Another pair of drawings, made by Burchell at Klaarwater in
                  December 1811, show a giraffe skin propped up on a wooden
                  scaffold in the midst of houses at the settlement, presumably
                  in the process of being preserved for Burchell’s collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Campbell first saw giraffes while approaching the
                  Orange River in June 1813, it was only at the end of July,
                  following his return from a visit to Tswana settlements
                  further north, that his party successfully shot one near
                  Griqua Town.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn20" id="page-chapter-3-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  While writing letters back to London, Campbell heard musket
                  shots and was fetched by a messenger who told him that the
                  hunters wanted him to see the giraffe before it died.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When he arrived, it had already collapsed, but Campbell was
                  amazed by its height, suggesting that a high horse could have
                  walked between its legs. Presented with the skin to take to
                  England by the person who shot it, presumably inspired by
                  Burchell’s keenness on acquiring a similar skin a year before,
                  Campbell happily added it to his collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the days that followed, Campbell was gratified when the
                  newly constituted ‘Griqua’, having agreed to a code of laws,
                  system of justice and his proposal they should adopt their own
                  currency, decided to rename one of their satellite settlements
                  ‘Campbell’ in his honour.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-3-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following the Gariep downstream before travelling south
                  through Namaqualand, Campbell’s party arrived back at Cape
                  Town at the very end of 1813.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meeting John Craddock, the Governor of the colony early in the
                  new year, Campbell was granted additional land for a new
                  mission in Albany which he optimistically named Theopolis, the
                  city of God.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-3-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Returning to Britain, Campbell arrived at Plymouth in May
                  1814, and immediately began speaking and preaching about his
                  journey – the giraffe skin was sent to the London taxidermist
                  Benjamin Leadbeater for preparation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early in 1815, Campbell published an account of his journey –
                  the frontispiece of which shows its diminutive author
                  sheltering from the African sun under an umbrella in a pose
                  reminiscent of the contemporary ‘selfie’.

                  The caption refers to the ‘waggons &amp;c’ pictured ‘on the

                  particularly the oxen, appear almost European, there is an
                  element of the image that make it clear Campbell must be in
                  Africa – the giraffe grazing on a tree in the background. This
                  is an echo of the giraffe that Le Vaillant had himself
                  depicted alongside for his own frontispiece a quarter century

                  Campbell’s return to London, accompanied all manner of
                  trophies from his travels, not least the skin of a giraffe,
                  appears to been the main reason why in the succeeding months
                  the Missionary Society decided to take a set of nine rooms in
                  the Old Jewry near Cheapside in the City of London, that

                  In June 1813, the&nbsp;<em>Evangelical Magazine</em>&nbsp;had been
                  rebadged the&nbsp;<em>Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle.</em>&nbsp;Missionary news was published under a separate header at the
                  back of the magazine and could be sent separately to Auxiliary
                  Missionary Societies on a monthly basis.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn24" id="page-chapter-3-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>

                  It was in the&nbsp;<em>Missionary Chronicle</em>&nbsp;for April 1815,
                  shortly after the publication of Campbell’s book, that the
                  opening of the Missionary Museum in London was announced.
                  Members and friends of the society were invited to apply for a
                  ticket to visit on Tuesday and Thursdays between 11am and 3pm

                  There, they would be able to gaze upwards at the towering
                  giraffe, a decade before the first living giraffe made its way
                  to the British Isles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-3-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  A further note was added, soliciting further donations:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>

                <p>
                  In April 1816 ‘idols of silver and copper’ arrived for the
                  museum from Ballari in Karnataka, South India. In September,
                  further ‘valuable curiosities’ from South Africa were
                  announced.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These had been sent by Rev. Mr George Thom, who had travelled
                  to South Africa with Campbell on his way to a missionary
                  posting in Calcutta, but had been asked to remain in Cape Town
                  as the Missionary Society’s agent. These items included:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>skins of a large lion, tyger, leopard, ant-eater, wild
                      boar, lynx, goo, spring buck, kangaroo. &amp; C.; together
                      with various kinds of serpents – the puff-adder, the
                      camelion and La Masité (commonly called The Hottentot’s
                      God).</em>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Though most of these items, like the giraffe, spoke more to
                  South Africa’s natural history than to its religious state,
                  the Afrikaans name for the praying mantis made it clear that
                  the religious understandings of southern African people were
                  not unrelated to the country’s wild creatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Soon afterwards ‘London’ was appended to the Missionary
                  Society’s official name, partly to distinguish it from the
                  Anglican Church Missionary Society, established in 1799.
                  However, this choice of name also seems to have connected to
                  the Society’s acquiring a physical headquarters with an
                  attached museum in the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In September 1817, following his return to London, William
                  Burchell presented 43 animals skins, including a pair of
                  giraffes, not to the Missionary Museum but to the British
                  Museum. Upset by the way in which the skins were subsequently
                  neglected and allowed to decay, he complained and a number
                  were eventually prepared for display.

                  By 1838 two of his giraffes were on display at the top of the
                  British Museum’s staircase, alongside the smaller giraffe from
                  the Hunterian collection, the first to reach Britain. An 1845
                  watercolour by George Scharf of the staircase at the British
                  Museum features this trio of giraffes, accompanied by a
                  diminutive rhinoceros.

                  While the skulls of the male and female giraffe presented to
                  the British Museum by Burchell have survived, one bisected and
                  the other with its horns sawn off, little else remains of the
                  three giraffes shot and skinned near Klaarwater between
                  October 1812 and July 1813.

                <p>
                  The 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum records that the
                  giraffe was shot in Griqua country by Mr Campbell’s party, but
                  also describes it in the following terms:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>This very peculiar animal inhabits the interior parts of
                      Africa, and the forests of Ethiopia. It is remarkable for
                      the great disproportion of height between the fore and
                      hind parts. The head is like that of a Stag; the neck is
                      slender; the tail long, with strong hairs at the end; the
                      whole is of a dirty white, marked with large broad rusty
                      spots. It is very timid, but not swift; it runs awkwardly,
                      and is easily taken. It browses on trees, yet can feed on
                      the grass, and drinks water from the brook. Its height is
                      from fifteen to seventeen feet, but some have been seen
                      more than twenty feet. The specimen is about sixteen
                      feet.</em>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <em>The Giraffe was known to the Romans in early times. It
                      appears among the figures in the assemblage of eastern
                      animals in the celebrated Praenestine Pavement, made by
                      the direction of Sylla, and is represented both grazing
                      and browsing, in its natural attitudes. It was exhibited
                      at Rome by the popular Caesar, among other animals, in the
                      Circasean Games.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-3-fn27" id="page-chapter-3-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup></em>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  While classical knowledge of giraffes was recalled in this
                  catalogue description, the detailed practical knowledge of
                  hunters such as Stoffel Speelman and Cupido Kakkerlak, as well
                  as their central role directing the journeys undertaken by
                  both Campbell and Burchell, was essentially obscured from view
                  when these giraffes were displayed in London.

                  William Ellis was only twenty-one years old when he arrived at
                  Port Jackson, Australia, in late July 1816. He had left
                  England on a Sunday morning, six months earlier, along with
                  187 convicts, a third of whom were younger than he was.

                  Ellis had been a junior gardener when he read the letters sent
                  by his pastor,
                  <a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-the-giraffe" target="_blank">John Campbell, from South Africa</a>. Yearning to become a missionary, he trained for a year, was
                  ordained and then married – the risks of sending unmarried
                  missionaries into the world having now been recognised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mary Mercy Moor, his wife, had been orphaned as a child but
                  was inspired to become a missionary after hearing Campbell
                  speak about his journey in London. As a young woman, however,
                  the only way viable way to embark on a life as a missionary in
                  1815 was as a missionary wife.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn1" id="page-chapter-4-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The voyage took the pair via Rio de Janeiro, where they
                  arrived at the same time as a slave ship from Africa, its deck
                  crowded with people of a similar age. But William and Mary
                  were not slaves or convicts, and their journey marked the
                  commencement of another sort of life.

                  Waiting in New South Wales for onward transport to Tahiti,
                  they stayed at Parramatta with the Hassells, the original
                  missionary family
                  <a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-the-cession-of-matavai" target="_blank">depicted in the Cession of Matavai</a>, who had left Tahiti in 1798.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn2" id="page-chapter-4-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was here that they would have heard of the arrival in
                  Sydney harbour of the <em>Queen Charlotte</em>, a ship that
                  traded with the islands, until recently captained by William
                  Shelley, another former missionary from the first
                  <em>Duff</em> voyage.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn3" id="page-chapter-4-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>

                  Alongside sandalwood and pork, another, extremely unusual,
                  cargo was unloaded – ‘nailed up in a case’ by missionaries at
                  Tahiti. It was addressed to Joseph Hardcastle, Treasurer of
                  the Missionary Society in London, and was making William and
                  Mary’s journey in reverse.

                  We have to imagine the wooden packing case being carried into
                  the Parramatta home of Samuel Marsden, the penal colony’s
                  senior churchman, who two years previously had begun a mission
                  to New Zealand under the aegis of the Anglican Church
                  Missionary Society. We don’t know who pulled the nails out of
                  the case, but it is likely to have been one of the many
                  convicts who worked for Marsden, herding sheep on the
                  thousands of acres of Australian bush, granted to Marsden by
                  the governor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  William and Mary Ellis had likely gazed up at
                  <a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-the-giraffe" target="_blank">Campbell’s giraffe</a>
                  in the newly opened Missionary Museum in London a year before,
                  but the artefacts revealed in Parramatta – carved from wood
                  and whale bone and bound with colourful feathers – were unlike
                  any they had seen. In a letter to Hardcastle, dated 31 October
                  1816, Marsden described them as ‘THE IDOL GODS OF OTAHEITE’:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <em>They are now lying prostrate on the table before me; and
                      were we not certain of the fact, we could not believe that
                      any human beings could place their salvation in these
                      wretched images, and offer up human sacrifices to avert
                      their anger</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn4" id="page-chapter-4-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>

                  Whether this Halloween display was deliberate on Marsden’s
                  part is hard to know from a distance of two centuries, but the
                  date’s significance could not have been lost on the many Irish
                  rebels transported to the penal colony. How the superstitious
                  sailors of the <em>Willerby</em>, the ship on which Marsden
                  forwarded the case to London, regarded these ‘idol gods’ can
                  only be imagined, but when the ship was wrecked off Ambon
                  Island, in what is now Indonesia, there must have been some
                  who blamed this ominous cargo.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn5" id="page-chapter-4-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                <p>
                  News of these ‘Idol Gods’ reached London in early 1818. An
                  announcement in February’s
                  <em>Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle</em> stated
                  that they ‘will enrich the Museum of the Society, and we shall
                  probably give a print of them in a future number of this
                  work’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn6" id="page-chapter-4-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>

                  In April the Missionary Society initiated a new quarterly
                  publication, <em>Missionary Sketches</em>,
                  <em>for the use of weekly and monthly contributors to the
                    Missionary Society.</em>
                  Each issue consisted of a single folded sheet, the front cover
                  given over to a large printed illustration.

                  Unfortunately, the first issue had to report that the ‘Idol
                  Gods’ had still not arrived, but that ‘correct sketches’ of
                  them would be presented to readers if they did. As a result,
                  the cover showed an ancient Trimurti sculpture from the
                  Elephanta caves in Mumbai Harbour, India, with Brahma, Shiva
                  and Vishnu presented as a three-headed being, suggestive of
                  the form of the Christian Trinity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn7" id="page-chapter-4-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>

                  When the ‘Idol Gods’ still hadn’t arrived by May, readers of
                  the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> were notified ‘in order to
                  prevent unnecessary trouble and disappointment’; presumably
                  anticipating the arrival of missionary supporters from around
                  the country for the Society’s 24th annual general meeting in
                  London.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the sermon that opened this meeting, the Rev. Ralph Wardlaw
                  from Glasgow preached on a verse from Acts xvii 16:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Now, while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was
                    stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to
                    idolatry.

                  Wardlaw proposed that ‘the contemplation of the idolatries of
                  the Heathen’ should keep alive and stimulate the missionary
                  spirit, inspiring indignant grief at the dishonour done to
                  God, amazement at human weakness, abhorrence of human impiety,
                  as well as compassion for human wretchedness.

                  His sermon, however, cautioned his listeners not to be
                  complacent, since ‘the guilt of idolatry… attaches itself to
                  many who little imagine that they are at all chargeable with
                  any thing of the kind’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn8" id="page-chapter-4-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>

                  It was at the Society’s business meeting the following day
                  that it was proposed and agreed that the official name of the
                  Society would become the <em>London Missionary Society,</em> a
                  move which made sense given the establishment of the Society’s
                  headquarters and museum in the city, three years earlier.

                  How was it that these ‘idol gods’ were given up by Tu (Pomare
                  II), the ‘young king’ depicted sitting on another man’s
                  shoulders in

                  For evangelicals at the time, the answer was divine Grace. A

                  provides an insight, associating the renunciation of idols
                  with the power and grace of ‘Britain’s God… by British

                  From our perspective, two centuries later, however, it seems
                  necessary to attempt to understand something of what had
                  happened in Tahiti during those two decades, and the
                  motivations that guided Pomare’s actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The exodus of missionaries from Tahiti in March 1798 had been
                  prompted by a conflict with Tu, the young king who became
                  Pomare II. He had been upset when missionaries tried to
                  prevent a visiting ship supplying him with guns and powder and
                  had a number of them publicly stripped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shortly afterwards Tu’s father, Pomare I, under whose
                  protection the remaining seven missionaries placed themselves,
                  tried to enlist their support in his military efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Politically, the situation at Tahiti was unstable, with
                  conflict emerging between father and son. In November 1798,
                  when Tu supported the execution of his ally, the priest
                  Ha’amanamani who had arranged the settlement of missionaries
                  at Matavai a year before, it was recorded of Tu in the
                  missionary journal that:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    We believe he is capable of committing any wickedness the
                    devil, his carnal mind, and bloodthirsty followers may
                    excite him to, if God did not restrain him.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn15" id="page-chapter-4-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In January 1800, much to the disapproval of the missionaries,
                  his father, Pomare I, acquired a ‘a carronade, two swivels,
                  several muskets and a great deal of ammunition’ from a
                  visiting ship, from which four sailors also deserted to assist
                  him.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn16" id="page-chapter-4-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In July 1801, the mission was reinforced with eight new
                  missionaries as well as one who had previously been at Tonga,
                  arriving with a fresh supply of stores.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1802, Henry Nott, a bricklayer who had remained at Tahiti
                  since the arrival of the <em>Duff</em> in 1797, began
                  preaching around the island, having developed sufficient
                  command of Tahitian. It was during his preaching tour that
                  Nott visited the <em>marae</em> or sacred place of Oro the god
                  of war at Atahuru.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here, Tu seized the <em>to’o</em> or representation of the
                  God, described by the missionaries as a ‘billet of wood’,
                  initiating a conflict that pitted him once more against his
                  father.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conflict and violence spiralled across the island, accompanied
                  by death and disease, and it was at around this time that Tu
                  began to show an interest in missionary’ preaching.

                  Many Tahitians blamed the increasingly dire situation on the
                  arrival of Europeans, connecting the political expansionism of
                  Pomare I and Tu to their alliances with Europeans over the
                  previous four decades. These included deploying the military
                  expertise of mutineers from the <em>Bounty</em> during the
                  late 1780s to establish their preeminence. The missionaries,
                  however, understood their suffering as God’s judgement for the
                  impieties of the Tahitians.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In September 1803 Pomare I died, changing the calculus of
                  Tahitian politics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Adopting the name Pomare II, Tu consolidated his position with
                  advice from a Hawaiian courtier, recently returned from
                  Europe. He began learning to read and write and attempted to
                  persuade the missionaries not to teach these skills to other
                  Tahitians.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In July 1805, Pomare began writing directly to the Directors
                  of the Missionary Society in London, receiving a response in
                  late 1806. In his subsequent reply, dated 1 January 1807,
                  Pomare II sought to deepen his relationship with the
                  directors, praising Jehovah and agreeing to ‘banish Oro, and
                  send him to Raiatea’, the island from which the cult of the
                  war god had come, and which remained its spiritual centre. In
                  return, Pomare II asked for ‘property and cloth as well as
                  muskets, powder, paper, ink and pens’, as well as ‘all the
                  curious things that you have in England’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn17" id="page-chapter-4-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Towards the end of 1808, discontent with Pomare II and his
                  close alliance with the missionaries initiated a rebellion, as
                  a result of which all but four of the unmarried missionaries
                  left Tahiti for the island of Huahine. The culmination of the
                  conflict was a major battle on 22 December 1808 that saw
                  Pomare II and his allies defeated, despite a prophet of Oro
                  promising them victory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The rebels ravaged Matavai, from where Pomare II and the
                  remaining missionaries fled to the neighbouring island of
                  Moorea. From there, all the missionaries except Henry Nott
                  went to Huahine, and in October 1809 all but one left for
                  Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Disillusioned with Oro, Pomare II spent a great deal of time
                  reading and thinking, developing a deeper interest in the God
                  of the missionaries through the counsel of Henry Nott. He told
                  Nott in July 1812 that he wanted to be baptised and when
                  questioned on the sincerity of his commitment, Pomare II
                  stated that ‘You do not know the thoughts of my heart, nor I
                  yours, but God does’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn18" id="page-chapter-4-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In August 1813 Pomare returned to Tahiti to reassert his
                  authority. The missionaries worried that he would be exposed
                  to alcohol and its attendant temptations. Nevertheless, his
                  renunciation of ‘the idol gods and the religion of his
                  country’ impressed the missionaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Visiting Tahiti, they discovered that a prayer-meeting had
                  been instituted with the names of the <em>Pure Atua</em> –
                  praying people – recorded in a book. By the end of 1814 this
                  included 204 names. In January 1815 the missionaries wrote to
                  London, concerned that Pomare wanted to be the first Christian
                  to be baptised among his people, while remaining, according to
                  them, ‘a slave to drinking’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn19" id="page-chapter-4-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In February 1815, the priest of Papetoai in Moorea, a man
                  named Patii, hit upon a way to convince the missionaries of
                  the true renunciation of the old gods. He took the
                  <em>to’o,</em> or God images, from the <em>marae</em> and
                  created a pyre on the beach. Reciting their names and
                  pedigrees, he stripped them of their coconut fibre wrapping
                  and feathers one by one before casting them into the fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This action initiated an outburst of iconoclasm that spread
                  rapidly across both Moorea and Tahiti, with Pomare encouraging
                  people to join this festival of flames.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An attempt to kill the <em>Pure Atua</em> (praying people) of
                  Tahiti saw them flee once more to Moorea, but they
                  subsequently returned to Tahiti with Pomare II at their head.
                  A battle on 12 November 1815, when the Christians were
                  attacked at church, proved decisive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whether the events in Tahiti during 1815 were related to the
                  eruption of Mount Tambora, a volcano on the Indonesian island
                  of Sumbawa, on 10 April is unclear from missionary accounts.
                  However, this was one of the largest volcanic events ever
                  recorded and atmospheric ash generated brilliantly coloured
                  sunsets all over the world for months. How these portents were
                  regarded in Tahiti can only be imagined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pomare’s restraint in exerting retribution following his
                  victory, including offering respectful burial to enemies
                  killed in battle, seems to have persuaded his erstwhile
                  enemies to accept his overlordship as a Christian king.
                  Following the victory, Pomare set about destroying ‘gods’ and
                  maraes, but also building churches as new places of worship.

                  If the <em>to’o</em> had been vehicles of spiritual power or

                  spiritual power in the form of Grace could be acquired,

                  The picture that emerges is one of religious and societal
                  transformation in which European missionaries, even by their
                  own admission, were not the principal actors – for most of the
                  key events on Tahiti itself, the missionaries remained in a
                  peripheral location on the island of Moorea, hearing news of

                  It was here that they were sent the ‘family idols’ by Pomare
                  II, together with his letter of explanation, dated February
                  19, 1816. A missionary translation printed in the Missionary
                  Chronicle for January 1818 renders the letter:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Friends,<br>
                    May you be saved by Jehovah and Jesus Christ our Saviour.
                    This is my speech to you, my friends. I wish you to send
                    those Idols to Britane for the Missionary Society, that they
                    may know the likeness of the gods that Tahiti worshipped.
                    These were my own idols, belonging to our family from the
                    time of Taaroamanahune even to Vairaatoa (Pomare I); and
                    when he died he left them to me. And now, having been made
                    acquainted with the true God, with Jehovah, He is my God,
                    and when this body of mine shall be dissolved in death, may
                    the Three-One save me!<br>
                    <br>The principal idol, that has the red feathers of the
                    Otuu is Temeharo, that is his name, look you, you may know
                    it by the red feathers; that was Vairaatoa’s own god, and
                    those feathers were from the ship of Lieutenant Watts (Lady
                    Penrhyn, 1788); it was Vairaatoa that set them himself about
                    the idol. If you think proper, you may burn them all in the
                    fire; or, if you like, send them to your country, for the
                    inspection of the people of Europe, that they may satisfy
                    their curiosity, and know Tahiti’s foolish gods!<br>
                    <br>Let me know also, what news there may be from Europe
                    and from Port Jackson. Perhaps King George may be dead, let
                    me know. I shall not go around Tahiti before the month of
                    March. May you be saved, my friends, by Jehovah, and Jesus
                    Christ the only Saviour by whom we sinners can be saved.<br>

                <p>
                  Could Pomare II have been responding to the appeal for
                  ‘curious articles’ for the Missionary Museum printed the April
                  1815 <em>Missionary Chronicle</em>? It is tempting to read his
                  reference to ‘curiosity’ as an echo of the
                  <em>Chronicle’s</em> language.
                </p>
                <p>
                  William Ellis, after he had arrived at Tahiti, recorded in his
                  diary for 26 April 1817 that Pomare had been ‘much pleased
                  with the portraits in the Evangelical Magazine, and some
                  prints of Natural History’, so it is not impossible that
                  Pomare would have seen the Missionary Chronicle.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn21" id="page-chapter-4-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, a journal of the Tahiti mission records that
                  magazines arrived from England on 29 December 1815, but none
                  dated later than the beginning of January 1814, which makes it
                  unlikely that Pomare would have seen the appeal for the new
                  Missionary Museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn22" id="page-chapter-4-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Earlier in the year, however, on 6 May 1815, the Queen
                  Charlotte had arrived at Moorea with letters dated between
                  December 1813 and July 1814. In the Missionary Chronicle of
                  May 1814 a notice had appeared noting the arrival of
                  ‘specimens of idols… especially from China’, which expressed
                  an intention on the part of the Society to exhibit them to
                  their friends:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    …not merely to gratify curiosity, but to excite their pity,
                    their prayers, and their exertions in behalf of millions of
                    their fellow-creatures, sitting in the region of the shadow
                    of death.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn23" id="page-chapter-4-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  While it is possible Pomare may have seen this, it probably
                  makes most sense to understand Pomare’s despatch of the idols
                  as part of his ongoing attempt to convince the missionaries of
                  the sincerity of his conversion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, he clearly wanted to develop a relationship of
                  exchange directly with the centre of missionary power in
                  London, rather than with missionary proxies in Tahiti. His
                  Hawaiian advisor with experience of London presumably gave
                  Pomare an important insight into the real locus of British
                  power.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pomare’s strategy was successful, resulting in a
                  correspondence with Rev. Dr. Haweis, initiator of the mission
                  to Tahiti. Writing in October 1818, just after his family
                  idols finally reached London, Pomare thanked Haweis for his
                  letter of August 1817 and the gift of books, as well as an
                  earlier gift of a pocket watch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pomare explained that a local Missionary Society had been
                  established in Tahiti to collect coconut oil, pork, arrow-root
                  and cotton as missionary tribute, informing Haweis that he had
                  decided to name a ship he had built at Tahiti after him. He

                  <p>
                    I have sent you the evil spirits (idols) which you sent to
                    me for. All the large idols are consumed, having been burned
                    in the fire. This is only a little one that remains. The
                    name of the little idol is Taroa.<br>
                    <br>I also send you two little fans which the Royal Family
                    of these countries were accustomed to fan themselves with.
                    When the day of the festival arrived, and the King was
                    prayed for, those were the fans they used to fan away the
                    flies. This was an established custom among the princes in
                    former times. The name of those fans is Nunaachau. They
                    fastened them to the handle, and this used them to drive
                    away the flies. What am I to do with the little pearl box,
                    which was enclosed in the parcel which you sent me? Had it
                    been directed to me, it would have been right; but there is
                    another name on it, that of the Queen of Lattakkoo; that is
                    the reason I inform you of it. I have sent back the little
                    pearl box to Mr Marsden at Port Jackson, that he may return
                    it to you. If you write to me again I shall be glad. If it
                    be agreeable, send me three books: one very large bible: one
                    good portable one, very small; and one book of
                    geography._<br>
                    <br>If it be not agreeable, very well, do not think evil
                    of me, dear friend, for the small request that I make in the
                    conclusion of my letter. We are well; and I shall be glad to
                    hear that you are well also.<br>
                    <br>May you be blessed by Jesus Christ, the true King of
                    Salvation, by whom we must all be saved.<br>

                  If Pomare’s ‘Family Idols’ were his response to a divine Gift
                  of Grace, he clearly didn’t anticipate the exchange ending
                  there, and his early requests for guns and powder were now
                  converted into requests for books and knowledge – sending
                  Pomare the books he requested was one of Haweis’ very last
                  acts on earth.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn25" id="page-chapter-4-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>

                <p>
                  It is easy to see how the evangelical theology of Grace,
                  freely given by God through the sacrifice of Christ could be
                  understand in relation to a Polynesian theology of
                  <em>mana</em> – divine and ancestral power – concentrated in
                  <em>to’o</em> and acquired through sacrifice and participation
                  in ceremonies. What need had Pomare for older <em>to’o</em> if
                  he could access <em>mana</em> through the word of God,
                  concentrated in the textual form of the bible and other books?

                  As a wave of conversion enveloped Tahiti and the surrounding
                  islands, the need for missionaries and bibles became
                  increasingly urgent. On 13 February 1817, William Ellis
                  finally arrived at Moorea, bringing with him a technology that
                  would prove central to the spread of Christianity across the
                  Pacific: a printing press. On 30 June 1817, Ellis looked on as
                  Pomare printed the very first page of a Tahitian spelling
                  book.

                  On 25 August 1819 the Rev. Rowland Hill, a founder and
                  Director of the London Missionary Society addressed a
                  Missionary Festival in Cornwall, gathered at the Independent
                  Chapel in Falmouth. According to a report in the Missionary
                  Chronicle:

                  <p>
                    Before the meeting closed the principal idol of Pomare’s
                    family was conveyed round the Chapel by Mr Hill’s servant:
                    its workmanship was admired for the ingenuity it displayed,
                    and while the idol itself excited commiseration for those
                    who still worship such ‘foolish Gods’, thanksgivings were
                    offered to Jehovah, that Taheite’s idols are no more!<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-4-fn26" id="page-chapter-4-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>

                  Such confidence that the ‘idols are no more’ seems strange in
                  retrospect, when it marked the very moment they had in fact
                  gone global – forwarded to London, they became a central
                  feature at the missionary museum, and the prototypes for
                  images that circulated around the world in missionary
                  publications.

                  This short paragraph illustrates the widespread circulation of
                  missionary imagery, and the way that missionary periodicals
                  enabled an enslaved congregation of a missionary chapel to
                  join a global Christian community in commenting on Tahitian
                  religious practices.<br>
                  Smith’s note suggests an attitude of incredulity that was
                  presumably shared by church-goers in Britain, and apart from
                  the hint of deliberate trickery, essentially ignores the clash
                  of religious practices underpinning his own missionary
                  engagements.<br>
                  These were given material form of sorts by a magical rattle
                  donated to the Missionary Museum a year earlier by John Wray,
                  Smith’s predecessor missionary at Le Resouvenir. According to
                  a catalogue of the Missionary Museum, printed in London in
                  1826, this was:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    An instrument of incantation used by the Pehemen, either to
                    drive away sickness or to inflict it. The natives tremble at
                    the rattle as though the earth was opening to swallow them
                    up, and would not dare to shake it except on special
                    occasions. They will rattle it a whole night over a person
                    who is ill, and at the same time sing their wild songs.<br>

                  Like the Cape, both Demerara and Berbice began as Dutch
                  commercial colonies. British control was consolidated during
                  the Napoleonic wars, so the British parliament’s 1807 Act for
                  the Abolition of the Slave Trade prohibited the further
                  importation of enslaved people from Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The rising political power of evangelicals in Britain
                  threatened the established economic model of plantation
                  slavery, but also led to an increasing presence of
                  evangelicals on the ground in the Caribbean. John Wray used to
                  tell his children that as he sailed into Demerara in February
                  1808, the last vessel to import a cargo of enslaved people
                  sailed out.<br>
                  This passing of ships, whether in the night or not, retains
                  its potential to symbolise an important shift in the tides of
                  Atlantic history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn2" id="page-chapter-5-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Directors of the Missionary Society despatched Wray, aged
                  27, to Demerara at the end of 1807 in response to a request
                  from Hermanus Hilbertus Post, the Dutch-born owner of Le
                  Resouvenir. Post had begun his career in the Caribbean in 1774
                  as an overseer, but soon acquired land on which he established
                  his plantation.<br>
                  Wracked by a sense of his own sinfulness and in pursuit of
                  redemption, Post built a chapel at Le Resouvenir capable of
                  accommodating 600 people. This was given the name Bethel, a
                  house of God in the ‘barren wilderness’ of slave-owning
                  Demerara.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn3" id="page-chapter-5-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup><br>
                  Wray’s arrival generated anxiety among the colony’s planters,
                  who feared he would turn Demerara into a second St Domingue –
                  Haiti having established its independence from France in 1804,
                  a mere four years earlier, following its 1791 revolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The planters accused Post of introducing ‘anarchy, disorder
                  and discontent among the enslaved’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn4" id="page-chapter-5-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  In 1808,
                  <em>The Demerara and Essequebo Royal Gazette</em> suggested:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    It is dangerous to make slaves Christians, without giving
                    them their liberty… What will be the consequence when to
                    that class of men is given the title of beloved brethren, as
                    is actually done? Will not the negro conceive that by
                    baptism, being made a Christian, he is as credible as his
                    Christian white brethren?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn5" id="page-chapter-5-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In a colony of approximately 2,500 White people, 2,500 free
                  Black people and 70,000 enslaved Black people, around half
                  African-born, the logic of race asserted itself in the face of
                  claims to Christian brotherhood. Just as in South Africa,
                  efforts were made by those with power to prevent missionaries
                  teaching the enslaved to read and write, lest they be exposed
                  to dangerous political texts from abroad.

                  When Wray began his work at Post’s plantation, he seems to
                  have worried mostly about the limited time available for
                  enslaved people to pursue religious interests. Sundays were
                  used to cultivate gardens for food as well as to sell produce
                  at market, so religious meetings were arranged in the evening,
                  when they had to compete with the ‘drumming, dancing,
                  intoxication and other evils’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn6" id="page-chapter-5-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup><br>
                  Exposure to Christian teaching was intended to reform these
                  activities – drumming and dancing in particular appearing to
                  suggest the ongoing influence of African religious practices.
                  As early as November 1808, Wray was reporting that after a
                  funeral, some of his congregation had assembled to sing hymns
                  and pray rather than ‘meeting together to drum and dance, as
                  formerly’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn7" id="page-chapter-5-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  A letter to London from Hermanus Post in January 1809
                  suggested that enslaved people on a neighbouring estate were:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    …formerly a nuisance to the neighbourhood, on account of
                    their drumming, dancing, &amp;c. Two or three nights in the
                    week, and were looked on with a jealous eye, on account of
                    their dangerous communications; but they are now become the
                    most zealous attenders of public worship… No drums are used
                    in this neighbourhood, except where the owners have
                    prohibited the attendance of their slaves. Drunkards and
                    fighters are changed into sober and peaceable people, and
                    endeavour to please those who are set over them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn8" id="page-chapter-5-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Wray reported that even the plantation manager was astonished
                  by the change in his charges, who ‘Before they heard the
                  Gospel, they were indolent, noisy and rebellious; but now they

                  would work without the application of the whip.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn9" id="page-chapter-5-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>

                  This was the argument abolitionists most wanted to make – that
                  improving conditions for enslaved people would result in less
                  brutality by overseers and more harmonious relations. At least
                  from the perspective of Post and Wray, religious conversion
                  formed a central plank in this project.

                  While the unenlightened attitudes of slave-owners was
                  something to be overcome, non-Christian religious practices
                  with roots in Africa among the enslaved posed an equal threat
                  to this new dispensation.<br>
                  In May 1811, Governor Bentinck of Demerara followed Jamaica in
                  banning assemblies of slaves between sunset and sunrise,
                  effectively prohibiting Wray’s church meetings. When his
                  appeals to the Governor were ignored, Wray left on a cotton
                  ship for Liverpool. Through evangelical circles in London, he
                  took his complaints to the heart of government.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Returning at the end of the year, Wray had secured an official
                  instruction to allow religious meetings on Sundays between
                  five in the morning and nine at night, and between seven and
                  nine in the evening on other days. When Governor Bentinck
                  attempted to delay the implementation of this policy, he was
                  recalled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wray, however, had drawn attention to himself in London, where
                  a major experiment was in the offing. Abolitionists had argued
                  that preventing the importation of further slaves would force
                  plantation owners to improve living conditions so that
                  enslaved people lived longer, were more productive and had
                  more children.

                  become responsible for 1100 ‘Crown slaves’ and in April 1811,
                  a Commission for Managing Crown Property in South America was
                  appointed. This consisted of prominent humanitarians and
                  abolitionists such as William Wilberforce and James Stephen,
                  who appointed Zachary Macauley, former governor of Sierra

                  Macauley wrote to Wray asking him to establish a mission to
                  ‘Crown slaves’ in Berbice funded by the British Government, in
                  order to advance their ‘intellectual and moral character’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn10" id="page-chapter-5-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup><br>
                  Interpreting this as a divine calling, Wray took on the
                  charge. He preached a final sermon at Le Resouvenir in June
                  1813 and took his family up the coast to New Amsterdam in
                  Berbice, still a largely Dutch-speaking colony.<br>
                  ‘Crown slaves’ were to be protected from the whip, provided
                  with task-based allocations of work and not given tasks that
                  could be undertaken by animals or machines. They were also to
                  be allowed a day a fortnight to cultivate their gardens,
                  freeing time for church on Sundays.<br>
                  It must have been with a degree of hopefulness that Wray
                  joined this experiment, although he was ultimately to clash
                  with the Commission’s agents in Berbice – its managers
                  regularly provoked Wray, impregnating his servants and
                  withholding his pay – as well as successive Governors
                  (Bentinck was appointed to Berbice in 1814, following his
                  removal from Demerara).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn11" id="page-chapter-5-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>

                  It was in Berbice that Wray became increasingly concerned with
                  the specifics of religious practices among the enslaved.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn12" id="page-chapter-5-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  In an interview during 1813, Joe, accused of Obeah at the
                  Crown plantation of Dageraad, told Wray that he was not an
                  Obeah man, but did have supernatural powers to counteract
                  Obeah by rites and incantations which he learned from ‘good
                  spirits’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn13" id="page-chapter-5-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When Wray asked to meet these spirits, Joe told him his images
                  and instruments, made from feathers and hair, had been
                  confiscated and damaged by the Crown Agent. The distinction
                  between malevolent action against others and healing or
                  preventive practice seems to have been important to enslaved
                  people, but was essentially ignored by Europeans. While Wray
                  dismissed much of what he was told, he concluded that ‘It is
                  impossible to describe the influence these men obtain over the
                  minds of the negroes’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn14" id="page-chapter-5-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Diana Paton has suggested that the term ‘Obeah’, first defined
                  as a crime in Jamaica following Tacky’s rebellion in 1760,
                  spread around the English-speaking Caribbean at this period –
                  ‘Obeah’ laws were passed in Berbice in 1801 and 1810.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn15" id="page-chapter-5-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tacky’s rebels had conducted oaths and rituals based on Akan
                  practices from the Gold Coast, now Ghana, so the Act to Remedy
                  Evils arising form the Irregular Assemblies of Slaves included
                  a clause outlawing ‘the wicked Art of Negroes going under the
                  appellation of Obeah Men and Women, pretending to have
                  Communication with the Devil and other evil spirits’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn16" id="page-chapter-5-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  If Obeah as a crime was originally associated with rebellion
                  and unrest, by implication the introduction of Christianity
                  should have been associated with peaceable relations between
                  the enslaved and their masters.<br>
                  This association was quickly challenged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1814 rumours circulated across Berbice of an insurrection
                  on the west coast, for which Wray was initially blamed by
                  planters. It turned out, however, that none of those involved
                  were ‘Crown slaves’, and an enquiry suggested that rather than
                  rebelling they had been attempting to establish a society on
                  the model of the Freemasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alternative forms of authority were nevertheless viewed with
                  suspicion, and six of those identified as ringleaders were
                  executed, decapitated and their heads put on stakes at their
                  home plantations. In addition, dancing was outlawed across the
                  colony for the rest of the year, with travel between estates
                  made conditional on the presentation of travel passes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn17" id="page-chapter-5-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 and the establishment
                  of peace in Europe, the Crown estates and the majority of
                  ‘Crown slaves’ were returned to the Society of Berbice in July
                  1816.

                  Wray remained in the colony, but his focus shifted to 300 or
                  so enslaved artisans retained by the Crown, as well as the
                  free residents of New Amsterdam. He continued to visit
                  congregations at the former Crown estates, just as he made
                  regular visits back to Le Resouvenir. It was presumably on one
                  of these visits that Wray came to hear of the mistreatment of
                  America, a woman from the Sandvoort estate.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn18" id="page-chapter-5-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hearing that her daughter had been flogged, she confronted the
                  mistress of the White estate manager who had taken her
                  daughter as a servant. For this ‘impertinence’, America, in
                  the late stages of pregnancy was stripped naked, tied to the
                  ground and given 170 lashes with a cart whip while the estate
                  manager watched, smoking his pipe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although she survived, she lost her child, but the case deeply
                  distressed Wray and his wife – their daughter reported that
                  ‘the lashes inflicted on these poor creatures seemed to eat
                  into his very soul’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn19" id="page-chapter-5-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  This distress was undoubtedly exacerbated by the fact that
                  Wray’s wife had until recently been providing midwifery
                  services to pregnant women on the estate.<br>
                  In search of justice, Wray once again sailed to Liverpool,
                  arriving in early 1818. While in England, he addressed a
                  number of Church meetings, pleading against the flogging of
                  women, but also presumably about the evils of Obeah. It was
                  during this visit that he presented the rattle to the
                  Missionary Museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In January 1819, after Wray had returned to Berbice, the
                  <em>Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle</em>
                  published a short report on the adoption of legal measures
                  against Obeah in Martinique, noting:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    In the Missionary Museum is one of the rattles, formed of a
                    hollowed fruit, with a long handle, employed by the Obeah
                    men in their malicious and cruel practices. We wish well to
                    the plans of the magistracy, but are persuaded that the
                    influence of the Gospel will prove the most effectual means
                    of suppressing this evil.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn20" id="page-chapter-5-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  While the description in the 1823 museum catalogue suggested
                  the rattle was used ‘to drive away sickness or to inflict it’,
                  the Evangelical magazine didn’t hesitate to emphasise that it
                  was used in ‘malicious and cruel practices’. The description
                  of its form, however, having been made from a hollowed fruit,
                  or more likely gourd, provides an important clue to its origin
                  and function.

                  While Wray’s interview with Joe mentions images and
                  instruments made from feathers and hair, it does not refer to
                  rattles. Shaman’s rattles, frequently made from hollowed
                  gourds, are, however, a feature of the ceremonial practices of
                  the indigenous peoples of the region, with whom Wray had also
                  been in contact.<br>
                  As early as December 1811, Wray wrote to London about a visit
                  to Georgetown, the capital of Demerara, by an indigenous
                  group, expressing an ambition to establish a mission among
                  them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn21" id="page-chapter-5-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In July 1816, Wray travelled up the Berbice river to visit
                  indigenous settlements. Here, he met an old man who told them
                  he was a Christian, having been baptised many years previously
                  by Moravians on the Courantyne River, the boundary of Berbice
                  with the Dutch colony of Suriname.<br>
                  In December of the same year, Wray travelled forty miles up
                  the Courantyne River to Equevi creek, where he visited two
                  Warrao villages with William Ross, ‘Protector of the Berbice
                  Indians‘.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn22" id="page-chapter-5-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It seems very likely that the rattle was collected on one of
                  these visits – from an indigenous shaman rather than an
                  enslaved ‘Obeah man’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is perhaps significant that apart from a ‘Boa Constrictor
                  in the act of devouring an antelope’, presumably a product of
                  taxidermy, the only other items associated with Wray in the
                  1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum were an unspecified
                  number of:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>WAR CLUBS curiously carved by South American Indians.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  A later version of the catalogue describes three
                  ‘quadrangular’ clubs of hard wood, ‘used by Macusi and
                  Caribbee Indians of Guiana’.<br>
                  The catalogue description of the rattle, given above, refers
                  to ‘the natives’ rather than enslaved people, many of whom in
                  1826 would not have been native, in that they would have been
                  born in Africa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It seems very likely, therefore, that Wray’s description of
                  the rattle as used by ‘the natives’ for healing was amended by
                  someone in London who had never been to the Caribbean to add
                  ‘an Instrument of Obeah, or Incantation, very dreadful to the
                  Negroes’.<br>
                  Alternatively, it could indicate the regard that enslaved
                  people had for the ceremonial practices of the indigenous
                  people of the land.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The British Museum has a rattle, acquired from the London
                  Missionary Society, that is recorded as coming from the
                  Berbice River in Guyana by its online catalogue. It is
                  described as: ‘Pelu, rattle made of gourd, cotton, feathers’.
                  The photograph online appears to match the sketch on a loan
                  slip, produced in 189 when the British Museum borrowed a
                  selection of rare items to display from the missionary museum
                  (LMS 6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn23" id="page-chapter-5-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Below a curator’s description, further text is recorded in
                  quotation marks, presumably from a label or written directly
                  on the rattle itself:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    515<br>
                    West Indies No. 10<br>
                    A pehi Berbice.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The number 515 relates to a catalogue produced for a large
                  missionary exhibition in Paris in 1867, the catalogue of which
                  describes 515 as:
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                    Pehemen, either to drive away sickness, or to inflict it.
                    The natives would not dare to shake it, except on special
                    occasions. They would rattle it all night over a person who
                    was ill, and at the same time sing their wild song.

                  While the description as ‘very dreadful to the negroes’ was
                  apparently removed from the text of the later museum
                  catalogue, it nevertheless still referred to the rattle as ‘an
                  instrument of Obiah’. This may suggest that from a missionary
                  perspective there was a degree of equivalence between the
                  healing practices of the enslaved people of African descent,
                  and the indigenous people of Guyana.<br>
                  In 1913, the colonial administrator and keen amateur
                  anthropologist Walter E Roth, then commissioner of the
                  Pomeroon District in British Guiana, published
                  <em>An Enquiry into the Animism and Folk-lore of the Guiana
                    Indians</em>. On page 330 he included a line drawing of a rattle, very
                  similar in form to that in the British Museum, which he
                  captioned <em>Piai’s rattle</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to Roth, hollowed gourds were filled with seeds and
                  stones with unusual origins which gave the rattle its power –
                  these included seeds extracted from the Piai teacher’s stomach
                  and stones that were a gift of the Water Spirits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Roth was told by an Arawak ‘medicine-man’ that the feathers
                  must come from a special kind of parrot (Psittacus aestivus)
                  and must be plucked from the bird while it is still alive. The
                  plumage of this species certainly seems to match the feathers
                  on the rattle in the British Museum, even though it is now
                  over 200 years old.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn24" id="page-chapter-5-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to Roth, the rattle itself is called, not a Pehi,
                  but a maráka, an Arawak word that has become common in
                  European languages, but was according to Arawak tradition a
                  gift from the Spirits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to Roth, it was ‘held in great veneration even by
                  Christian converts who have ceased to use it’ while people may
                  ‘fear to touch it or even approach a place where it is
                  kept’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn25" id="page-chapter-5-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the context of missionary activity and conversion, what
                  could be a more powerful tangible demonstration of conversion
                  than to hand one of these potent rattles to a missionary? In
                  addition to being a gift that demonstrated an intention to
                  renounce spiritual practices, giving a rattle to someone like
                  Wray removed it from a location where it posed a risk and
                  could continue to cause harm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the 1960s, the anthropologist Peter Riviere similarly
                  agreed to take a converted Trio’s shaman’s rattle away with
                  him, ultimately donating it to the Pitt Rivers Museum. It
                  seems that for a shaman, sending away a rattle that linked you
                  with your spirit familiars, with which you had a close and
                  intimate relationship, was easier than destroying it – one
                  Trio shaman stated ‘they are like children to me… Who in the
                  world destroys something that is like a child to him?’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn26" id="page-chapter-5-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I contacted Peter Riviere to ask whether he could help me
                  to make sense of the rattle and Wray’s description, he told me
                  that he thought Pehi was a transliteration of piai, a word
                  widely used to mean shaman or healer. The Oxford English
                  Dictionary records the word being used in English from 1613
                  onwards to refer to people who were glossed as priests,
                  doctors, diviners, charmers, sorcerers or soothsayers. This
                  suggests that no satisfactory English equivalent was
                  available. Riviere thought that Peheman was almost certainly a
                  transliteration of piaiman or piaime, meaning the practice of
                  ‘being shamanic’ – a quality that in indigenous thought
                  everyone has, but only some develop to a high degree of
                  mastery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn27" id="page-chapter-5-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The rattle then, was not unlike the ‘Idol Gods’ sent from
                  Tahiti by Pomare as a token of conversion, and actually seems
                  to have arrived at the Missionary Museum in London before the
                  long-delayed parcel from the Pacific. It has not retained the
                  same notoriety, illustrated by the fact that its association
                  with Wray and the early mission to Guyana was forgotten at the
                  British Museum.

                  What has been most widely remembered about Wray and Smith’s
                  early mission in Guyana occurred in the years after the
                  rattle’s arrival in London.

                <p>
                  In July 1822, Wray visited his former congregation at Le
                  Resouvenir in Demerara, which had been under John Smith’s
                  ministry since 1817. He was pleased with what seemed to be a
                  functioning Christian congregation and the 2000 people under
                  instruction for Catechism, although he lamented that the
                  missionaries were still not allowed to teach their charges to
                  read.

                  founded in London, as leadership of the anti-slavery movement
                  was passed from William Wilberforce, who had effected
                  parliamentary abolition of the trade in 1807, to Thomas Fowell
                  Buxton. Their first achievement was the passing of a
                  parliamentary resolution recommending further reforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a result, regulations were sent to Crown colonies limiting
                  labour for the enslaved to nine hours a day, and abolishing
                  the flogging of women. While the Governor of Berbice asked
                  Wray to announce these policies from his pulpit, in Demerara
                  Governor Murray attempted to delay the implementation of these
                  measures. Rumours spread, and some believed he was suppressing
                  a full grant of freedom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After six weeks with no announcement, a meeting was held on
                  one of the estates that neighboured Le Resouvenir after the
                  church services on Sunday 17 August 1823. The following day
                  some of the enslaved congregation came out on strike.<br>
                  When the Governor rode out to meet a group of forty men who
                  had gathered, finally telling them the details of the new
                  regulations, they refused to lay down their weapons and shots
                  were fired.

                  The subsequent uprising seems to have been initiated by Jack
                  Gladstone, son of Quamina (or Kwamina/Kwami) a carpenter and
                  stalwart member and deacon of John Smith’s congregation at Le
                  Resouvenir. Jack took his surname from the owner of his
                  estate, Sir John Gladstone, whose own son William would the
                  become Prime Minister of Britain 45 years later.<br>
                  While Quamina seems to have attempted to prevent an outbreak
                  of extreme violence, locking estate overseers and managers in
                  the stocks rather than killing them, the Governor and planter
                  society marshalled troops to send out against the rising.<br>
                  200 people were killed in the action and martial law was
                  imposed, with a further 50 people put to death and many others
                  whipped.

                  Quamina seems to have been blamed for the uprising and was
                  shot while fleeing, his prayer book and hymn book still in his
                  pocket. Instead of receiving a church burial, his body was
                  hung from a gibbet at the entrance to the estate on which he
                  had lived. Jack Gladstone was captured, sold and deported to
                  St Lucia.

                <p>
                  Amidst the uprising, rumours spread among planters that
                  missionaries had prior knowledge of its organisation because
                  of their close connections with a number of the ringleaders.
                  John Smith was arrested and held for seven weeks, before being
                  tried by Court Martial on 13 October 1823 for four charges
                  that included:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Promoting ’discontent and dissatisfaction in the minds of
                    the Negro Slaves towards their Lawful Masters, Managers and
                    Overseers’ and exciting Revolt

                    before and during the revolt

                  <li>
                    Not making the intended rebellion known to the proper
                    authorities
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Not using his best endeavours to suppress, detain and
                    restrain Quamina once the rebellion was under way.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-5-fn28" id="page-chapter-5-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  </li>

                <p>
                  Found guilty of all four charges, Smith was sentenced to death
                  by hanging, but the court recommended mercy ‘under the
                  circumstances of the case’. The final decision was referred to
                  London, at which point Smith was taken to an ordinary gaol
                  where he was held for another seven weeks.

                  Already unwell, Smith died on 6 February 1824, before the news
                  reached Demerara that his life was to be spared (but banished
                  from all British Caribbean colonies). Authorities arranged for
                  his burial to be carried out secretly in the middle of the
                  night and demolished the grave his supporters built.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a result of Smith’s death, the London Missionary Society
                  gained its first martyr – in the years that followed he became
                  widely known as the ‘Demerara Martyr’. Outrage in Britain at
                  Smith’s death – together with the widespread loss of life
                  among the enslaved – played a significant role in mobilising
                  public support for the campaign to abolish slavery,
                  culminating in the 1833 Act for the abolition of slavery
                  throughout the British Colonies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2018, the President of Guyana, David Granger declared that
                  20 August would henceforth be known as ‘Demerara Martyrs’
                  Day’, extending the category of martyrdom to all those who
                  participated and were killed in the uprising. He committed to
                  building a new memorial at Independence Park in the capital,
                  the former parade ground where the executions of those
                  condemned to death by Court Martial were carried out.

                <p>
                  In September 1819, shortly after the ‘principal idol’ sent by
                  Pomare II from Tahiti was conveyed around a Chapel in
                  Falmouth, Cornwall, the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> reported
                  the arrival in London of further additions to the Missionary
                  Museum. Sent by the Rev. Henry Townley as a gift from the
                  Bengal Auxiliary Missionary Society, they were described as:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Twenty-two models of Hindoo deities, (carved in wood, about
                    a foot in height, and painted) such as are ordinarily
                    manufactured in that idolatrous country. Prints taken from
                    these are intended to be given in the Missionary Sketches,
                    accompanied by explanations from the Rev. Mr. Ward’s History
                    of the Literature and the Religion of the Hindoos.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn1" id="page-chapter-6-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  A month after their arrival, the cover of
                  <em>Missionary Sketches</em> featured nine of Townley’s
                  models, each with the name of the God they depicted printed
                  beneath.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn2" id="page-chapter-6-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup><br>
                  Abbreviated descriptions of each God, summarising Ward’s text,
                  were given on the following pages. In a footer at the end of
                  the descriptions, a paragraph clarified their intended
                  message, positioning the work of missionaries in India as a
                  direct continuation of a long-term battle against religious
                  idols, documented in both the Old and New Testaments of the
                  Bible:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    These are specimens, Christian Reader, of the gods of the
                    heathen in India, worshipped by more than a hundred millions
                    of deluded people. These are the creatures of a corrupt
                    imagination, and the workmanship of men’s hands ­­­— “they
                    have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
                    see not; they have ears, but they hear not; they have hands,
                    but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not;
                    neither speak they through their throat. They that make them
                    are like unto them; so is every one that trusted in them. O
                    Israel, trust thou in the Lord.” Psalm cxv. 5—10.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn3" id="page-chapter-6-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  These conjunctions of artefact, image and text illustrate the
                  strong connections between items sent to the Missionary Museum
                  and the images and texts that appeared in missionary
                  publications. It seems likely that Townley, like John Smith in
                  Demerara, had seen the early issues of
                  <em>Missionary Sketches</em> from 1818, featuring the Trimurti
                  from Elephanta, Mantis the Soothsayer from South Africa, and
                  the Family Idols of Pomare from Tahiti. A fairly recent
                  arrival in India, Townley had been sent to Calcutta by the
                  Missionary Society’s Directors in 1816.

                  The Rev. Mr. Ward, on the other hand, was William Ward,
                  something of a veteran with nearly two decades of experience
                  working for the Baptist Missionary Society in India. In the
                  aftermath of the French Revolution, non-conformist churches in
                  Britain had been associated with political radicalism, and the
                  official line of the East India Company prohibited their
                  missionaries from operating in areas it controlled.
                  Sympathetic Company officials, however, had turned a blind eye
                  to the activities of William Carey, the original Baptist
                  missionary, after he arrived in India in 1793, particularly
                  when he was officially employed on an indigo plantation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn4" id="page-chapter-6-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>

                  The arrival of William Ward, along with three other Baptist
                  missionaries and their families, in 1799, was harder to
                  ignore. The recently arrived Anglo-Irish Governor-General,
                  Richard Wellesley, pursuing a war against the French and their
                  allies in Mysore, refused them permission to join Carey in
                  Bengal. As a consequence, the Baptists established themselves
                  at Serampore, a Danish controlled town less than twenty miles
                  north of Calcutta, the capital of British India, much to
                  Wellesley’s initial displeasure.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn5" id="page-chapter-6-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                  Originally a printer and journalist from Derby in the British
                  Midlands, Ward was responsible for the printing press at
                  Serampore, established in 1800, where translations of the
                  Bible were printed in Bengali, Marathi, Hindi and other Indian
                  languages.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn6" id="page-chapter-6-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  The project of religious translation involved working closely
                  with Indian scholars such as Ram Ram Basu, who worked for
                  Carey as his <em>munshi</em> (language teacher).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn7" id="page-chapter-6-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>

                  When Governor Wellesley established Fort William College in
                  Calcutta in 1801, it was Carey he appointed to teach Bengali,
                  assisted by Basu. The project of translation operated in
                  multiple directions: Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and
                  Ramayana were published in Bengali in 1802-03. From 1805 the
                  Baptists were even paid a stipend by the Asiatic Society at
                  Fort William College to translate and publish Sanskrit texts
                  in English.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn8" id="page-chapter-6-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>

                  The first volume of Ward’s
                  <em>Account of the Writings, Religion, and Manners of the
                    Hindoos including Translations from their Principal
                    Works</em>
                  was printed at the Mission Press in Serampore in 1806, with
                  the fourth volume completed in 1811, just before a fire
                  destroyed the print works (Ward 1811). A second edition,
                  ‘carefully abridged and greatly improved’, was printed between
                  1815 and 1818 under the title
                  <em>A View of the History, Literature, and Religion of the
                    Hindoos</em>, with a third edition printed in Britain by the Baptist
                  Missionary Society between 1817 and 1820.

                  A compendium of Indian religious texts printed in English,
                  alongside descriptions of Hindu practice, Ward provided
                  British evangelicals with an accessible guide to ‘the religion
                  of the Hindoos‘. Even before the arrival in London of
                  Townley’s ‘models’, Ward’s text had been used to compile a
                  description that accompanied an image of Ganesh that was
                  printed in the
                  <em>Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle</em> in
                  March 1818.

                  It was noted that many Hindus kept a small metal image of the
                  god in their houses for daily worship. The
                  <em>Evangelical Magazine</em>, however, was not content to
                  adopt a position of straightforward condescension in relation
                  to this ‘idolatry’, noting that:

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The superstitious regard paid by these blind idolaters to a
                    senseless image, may put to shame many who are better
                    informed, and who call themselves Christians, but who live
                    practically “without God in the world”; who never
                    acknowledge the Creator and Preserver; and who daily go out
                    and return home, amidst a thousand dangers, without seeking
                    his guidance or protection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn9" id="page-chapter-6-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>

                  The London Missionary Society sent their first missionary to
                  India in 1798. Arriving five years after William Carey, also
                  without an official licence, Nathaniel Forsyth preached in and
                  around Calcutta with the tacit support of Company officials.
                  With minimal financial assistance from the Society in London,
                  he found Calcutta expensive and lived for a time on a boat,
                  until appointed minister of the Dutch church at Chinsurah
                  (Hugli-Chuchura) in West Bengal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn10" id="page-chapter-6-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>

                  Only in 1804 were further missionaries sent to India by the
                  LMS, but they went to the south. In the early decades of the
                  nineteenth century, the major Indian campaigns undertaken by
                  the Society seem to have been largely conducted through a war
                  of words in London.<br>
                  In July 1806 an uprising at Vellore Fort in Tamil Nadu, South
                  India, following the implementation of new uniform regulations
                  involving the trimming of beards and removal of caste marks,
                  was connected to the circulation of rumours about forced
                  conversion to Christianity. Evangelicals sought to blame the
                  family of Tipu Sultan, imprisoned at the fort, as well as the
                  Madras administration, invoking the weight of British
                  evangelical opinion in an attempt to avert a wholesale recall
                  of missionaries from India.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn11" id="page-chapter-6-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Making the case for the opposition was the Rev. Sydney Smith,
                  who, in his essay ‘Indian Missions’ published in
                  <em>The Edinburgh Review</em> of February 1808, quoted the
                  Transactions of the Missionary Society at length to illustrate
                  the strong reactions missionary activity provoked in India.
                  Smith argued that it was perilous to proselytise in a
                  precarious India ‘without incurring the utmost risk of losing
                  our empire’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn12" id="page-chapter-6-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  In the essay, which Smith himself later characterised as
                  ‘routing out a nest of consecrated cobblers’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn13" id="page-chapter-6-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>, he famously asked: ‘Why are we to send out little
                  detachments of maniacs to spread over the fine regions of the
                  world the most unjust and contemptible opinion of the
                  gospel?’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn14" id="page-chapter-6-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evangelicals were ultimately successful in defending the
                  admittedly fairly ambiguous status quo, but many of the same
                  arguments resurfaced in the years leading up to the British
                  government’s renewal of the East India Company’s charter in
                  1813.<br>
                  Evangelical networks across the British Isles were mobilised
                  in a campaign that led to 908 petitions supporting the
                  promulgation of Christianity in India being submitted to the
                  British parliament, at that time the largest number ever
                  presented.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn15" id="page-chapter-6-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  In a parliamentary compromise orchestrated by William
                  Wilberforce, all sides were enabled to believe they had
                  achieved some of their aims. A new clause in the charter of
                  the East India Company made it:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    the Duty of this country, to promote the interests and
                    happiness of the native inhabitants of the British dominions
                    in India, and that such measures ought to be adopted as may
                    tend to the introduction among them of useful knowledge, and
                    of religious and moral improvement. That in the furtherance
                    of the above objects, sufficient facilities shall be
                    afforded by law, to persons desirous of going to, and
                    remaining in India, for the purpose of accomplishing those
                    benevolent designs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn16" id="page-chapter-6-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>

                  One of the major consequences of this clause was the
                  establishment of schools across India, including for girls,
                  supported financially by the East India Company—the Rev.
                  Robert May of the London Missionary Society established 30
                  schools, educating nearly 3000 children including 700 sons of
                  Brahmins in and around Chinsurah between 1812 and 1816.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn17" id="page-chapter-6-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  The exterior, interior and plan view of one of these schools
                  was depicted on the cover of <em>Missionary Sketches</em> in
                  October 1820, a year after the cover had featured Townley’s
                  ‘Hindoo Idols’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn18" id="page-chapter-6-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was in the wake of this campaign and the resulting new
                  clause that Henry Townley had been sent to re-establish the
                  Society’s mission at Calcutta, following the death of Forsyth.
                  The Bengal Auxiliary Missionary Society was established in
                  December 1817 to raise funds locally to support missionary
                  activity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn19" id="page-chapter-6-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  Prompted to contribute to the stock of missionary images,
                  Townley, acting on behalf of the Auxiliary Society either
                  purchased or commissioned a set of 22 ‘murti’ (models) images
                  of Hindu gods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is significant these were described as ‘models’. This may
                  have been an attempt to translate the word murti, which
                  carries a sense that such figures take the material form of a
                  god, without being gods in themselves, but it more likely
                  suggests that they were acquired from the craftspeople who
                  made them, rather than from temples or homes, where they had
                  already been the focus for puja or bhakti (religious
                  devotion). Unlike Pomare’s Family Idols, these were not given
                  up by converts to Christianity, but they remained useful in
                  illustrating the religious practices of India for missionary
                  supporters across the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fact that eight of the murti were arranged on the cover of
                  <em>Missionary Sketches</em> around the black-faced figure of
                  Jugunnathu is significant, reflecting this figure’s centrality
                  to early nineteenth century British imaginations of Indian
                  religion. A note in parentheses in the accompanying written
                  account points out that the name of this God is ‘usually
                  written Juggernaut’, explaining that this name is a title for
                  a deified hero meaning ‘Lord of the World’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn20" id="page-chapter-6-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The form of the image, with no legs and only stumps for arms
                  but a very large head and eyes was explained: having been
                  commissioned to house the bones of Krishna, its maker was
                  interrupted at work, leaving the image unfinished. Brahma,
                  himself, however, was said to have given the murti its eyes
                  and a soul.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The focus of the printed description in
                  <em>Missionary Sketches</em> then shifts from the image itself
                  to the temple to Jagganath in Orissa and its annual Car
                  Festival. As part of this, the crowd drew a tapering tower
                  containing the image of Jagganath, between 50 to 60 feet high
                  and with sixteen wheels. The description ends by noting:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>

                    attend this festival, among whom a great mortality
                    frequently prevails; and hundreds, perhaps thousands of
                    persons, diseased or distressed, have cast themselves under
                    the wheels of this ponderous car, and have been crushed to

                  at Puri, a major site of regional pilgrimage, under the
                  control of the East India Company. The appointment by the
                  Company of a tax collector and committee to manage temple
                  affairs upset evangelicals, who argued that this amounted to
                  state-sponsored idolatry.

                  The person most responsible for advancing this concern was
                  Claudius Buchanan, an evangelical Scottish Anglican minister
                  appointed to an East India Company chaplaincy in Bengal in
                  1796, who became vice-provost of Fort William College in 1800,
                  where he worked closely with William Carey.<br>
                  In 1811 Buchanan published
                  <em>Christian Researches in Asia</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn22" id="page-chapter-6-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  and in December of that year, the
                  <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> syndicated his description of
                  the festival of Juggernaut in order to ‘kindle the zeal of
                  European Christians in the support and extension of Missionary
                  efforts’ by becoming ‘more intimately acquainted with the
                  horrors of Heathenism’:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I have returned home from witnessing a scene which I shall
                    never forget. At twelve o’clock of this day, being the great
                    day of the east, the Moloch of Hindoostan was brought out of
                    his temple, amidst the acclamations of hundreds of thousands
                    of his worshippers […]<br>
                    The idol is a block of wood, having a frightful visage,
                    painted black, with a distended mouth of a bloody colour […]
                    An aged minister of the idol then stood up; and, with a long
                    rod in his hand, which he moved with indecent action,
                    completed the variety of this disgusting exhibition. I felt
                    a consciousness of doing wrong in witnessing it […] The
                    characteristics of Moloch’s worship are obscenity and blood.
                    We have seen the former. Now comes the blood.<br>
                    After the tower had proceeded some way, a pilgrim announced
                    that he was ready to offer himself a sacrifice to the idol.
                    He laid himself down in the road before the tower, as it was
                    moving along, lying on his face, with arms stretched
                    forwards. The multitude passed round him, leaving the space
                    clear, and he was crushed to death by the wheels of the
                    tower. A shout of joy was raised to the god. He is said to
                    smile when the libation of the blood is made. The people
                    threw cowries, or small money, on the body of the victim, in
                    approbation of the deed. He was left to view a considerable
                    time, and was then carried by the hurries to the Golgotha,
                    where I have just been viewing his remains. How much I
                    wished that the Proprietors of India Stock could have
                    attended the wheels of Juggernaut, and seen this peculiar
                    source of their revenue!<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn23" id="page-chapter-6-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Buchanan’s reference to Moloch connected Jagannath to the Old
                  Testament book of Leviticus but also to Milton’s
                  <em>Paradise Lost</em>, making it clear he regarded the
                  procession at Puri as a form of demonic idolatry, endorsed and
                  managed by a British commercial company. The image of the
                  immense and unstoppable car of Juggernaut, crushing pilgrims
                  beneath its wheels was so potent that it captured early
                  nineteenth century evangelical opinion, finding an enduring
                  place in the English language.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn24" id="page-chapter-6-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>

                  In the years that followed, the front cover of
                  <em>Missionary Sketches</em> featured further Indian gods,
                  with commentary supplied by Ward. In July 1820, an image of
                  ‘Kalee, the black goddess of India’ included a description of
                  the animal sacrifices Ward witnessed at a festival in
                  Calcutta:

                <blockquote>

                    The whole scene produced on my mind sensations of greatest
                    horror. The dress of the singers – their indecent gestures –
                    the abominable nature of the songs – the horrid din of their
                    miserable drum – the lateness of the hour – the darkness of

                    immortal creatures, capable of such superior enjoyments,
                    were, in the very set of worship, perpetrating a crime of

                  Rumours of human sacrifices to Durga were reported, and a
                  footnote enumerated the far larger number of annual deaths in
                  ways that were, according to Ward, sanctioned by the ‘shasters
                  (religious books of the Hindoos)’, which he had calculated:

                  Ram Ram Basu, who worked with Carey from the 1790s onwards and
                  never converted to Christianity, nevertheless argued for the
                  reform of Hinduism based on the Vedas. He even wrote a Bengali
                  text about Jesus Christ, <em>Christabibaranamrta</em>, in
                  1803.

                <p>
                  In 1817, Mrityunjaya Vidyalankar, an orthodox Brahmin depicted
                  working alongside William Carey on translations at Fort
                  William College compiled a legal report suggesting that the
                  practice of sati (widow burning) was not sanctioned by any
                  Indian holy texts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn32" id="page-chapter-6-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>

                  Most famously, Rammohum Roy, who worked alongside Basu,
                  Vidyalankar and Carey at Fort William College spearheaded a
                  movement to reform Hinduism, the principal targets of which
                  were shared with evangelical missionaries: idolatry, the caste
                  system and sati. Sometimes remembered as the ‘father of the
                  Bengal Renaissance’, Roy was significantly influenced by his
                  engagement with Christianity, publishing The Precepts of
                  Jesus, the Guide to Peace and Happiness in 1820, setting out
                  ethical teachings drawn from the gospels.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn33" id="page-chapter-6-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Criticised by some Baptist missionaries for extracting the
                  teaching of Jesus from their framing within a narrative of
                  salvation by grace, premised on Christ’s sacrifice on the
                  cross, Roy continued working on a revised translation of the
                  New Testament with the Baptist Missionary William Adam, only
                  for Adam to leave the Baptists to establish a Unitarian
                  Society in Calcutta with Roy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-6-fn34" id="page-chapter-6-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>

                  The Catalogue of the Missionary Museum, printed in 1826,35
                  begins its East Indies section with Case H, containing 21
                  named and numbered ‘Indian idols’. The nine murti depicted in
                  October 1819 are all listed, in many cases alongside
                  descriptions taken directly from the text of
                  <em>Missionary Sketches</em>. In addition to these nine, the
                  following were included in the same list, albeit without the
                  same degree of further description:

                  The original note in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> of
                  September 1819 referred to ‘twenty-two models of Hindoo
                  deities’. In the seven years between their arrival and the
                  publication of the catalogue, one seems to have been lost or
                  broken.

                <p>
                  Although they appear in nineteenth century images, such as
                  that depicting the case ‘Indian Idols’ at the Missionary
                  Museum, published in 1860, I haven’t been able to locate any
                  of the original twenty-two models, two centuries after they
                  arrived in London.

                  The closest I have come is a somewhat damaged painted clay
                  figure of Jagganath held by the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford
                  (1910.62.84). Made from clay rather than wood, it has a
                  different, less waisted, shape to the image located at the
                  centre of the cover of <em>Missionary Sketches</em> in October
                  1819.

                  It therefore seems more likely to be one of the numerous other
                  representations of Jagganath associated with the London
                  Missionary Society, including some that found their way into a
                  case chiefly featuring images of the Buddha in 1860.

                        Together with Roy and Dwarkanath Tagore, Adam founded
                        the Calcutta Unitarian Committee in 1821.⁠ In 1828, Roy
                        left the Unitarians to establish Brahmo Samaj, a Hindu
                        version of Unitarianism, based on the Vedas. In 1829 he
                        journeyed to England to lobby for a law to be passed by
                        the British parliament against Sati or widow burning.
                        Roy became a supporter of the 1832 Reform Bill, hoping
                        that Britain might succeed in ‘banishing corruption and
                        selfish interests from public proceedings’ but sadly
                        became ill and died in Bristol where he was buried in
                        1833.

                  <em>His Majesty’s Ship Mermaid</em> dropped anchor alongside
                  eleven American whaling ships, each with a capacity of 300 to
                  350 tons, in the bay where Captain James Cook had been killed
                  43 years earlier.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fn1" id="page-chapter-7-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  By comparison, she was tiny – a 61 ton copper sheathed cutter
                  built in Howrah, opposite Calcutta on the Hooghly River, where
                  <a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-twenty-two-models-of-hindoo-deities" target="_blank">Henry Townley acquired his models of ‘Hindoo Deities’</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Purchased by the British navy at Port Jackson in 1817, the
                  <em>Mermaid</em> was put to work surveying the Australian
                  coastline before delivering a first cargo of convicts to the
                  new penal settlement at Port Macquarie.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fn3" id="page-chapter-7-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  An image of the ship seems to have been scratched onto rocks
                  at Enderby Island in Western Australia.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  She was then given a new mission: to deliver another ship,
                  <em>The Prince Regent</em>, to the Sandwich Islands, as
                  Hawai’i was widely known to English speakers at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>The Prince Regent</em> was a gift, presented in
                  recognition of Hawaiian assistance during the war of 1812
                  between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and
                  the United States of America. Built at Port Jackson, she was a
                  70 ton copper bottomed schooner equipped with six guns. After
                  1811, during the mental illness of King George III, Britain
                  was ruled by his son as Prince Regent, hence the vessel’s
                  name. In January 1820 George III passed away, eight months
                  after Kamehameha I, the King of Hawai’i.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like his near contemporaries, Pomare in Tahiti and Napoleon in
                  Europe, Kamehameha pursued a strategy of military expansion.
                  During his reign he established a united kingdom across the
                  Hawaiian Islands using European weapons, with strategic input
                  from his British advisors, John Young and Isaac Davies. George
                  III’s reign had seen the political union ofthe kingdoms of
                  Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, but also the loss of the
                  colonies that became the United States of America.

                <p>
                  It is perhaps unsurprising that as ruler of an island kingdom,
                  Kamehameha preferred to pursue an alliance with the British,
                  rather than the Republican and continental USA. Ultimately,
                  <em>The Prince Regent</em>, as a gift, would link the
                  succeeding generation of island kings, George IV, previously
                  the Prince Regent, and Kamehameha II, also known as Liholiho.
                  When the twenty-one year old assumed the throne, however, he
                  had been greeted by Queen Ka’ahumanu, wearing his father’s
                  royal robe. She declared she would rule alongside him as
                  <em>Kuhina Nui</em> or Queen Regent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In November 1819, at a feast to commemorate Kamehameha I,
                  Liholiho sat down and ate with the royal women, inaugurating
                  the end of the existing <em>kapu</em> (taboo) system – a
                  period now referred to in Hawaiian as the
                  <em>Ai Noa</em> (free eating). It seems likely that this
                  action was at least partly inspired by the actions of Pomare
                  II in Tahiti during 1815, since both Liholiho and Ka’ahumanu
                  were aware of what had happened there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of March 1822, however, it was not
                  <em>The Prince Regent</em> that the <em>Mermaid</em> brought
                  to Kealakekua Bay, having lost sight of her charge on their
                  way across the Pacific, but rather a party of twelve
                  missionaries. En route to Hawai’i from Australia, the two
                  vessels had stopped at Huahine, near Tahiti, where Captain
                  Kent of the <em>Mermaid</em> had been persuaded to make space
                  for them on board.

                  Having established the missionary printing press at Mooreain
                  June 1817, William Ellis oversaw the printing of 7000 Tahitian
                  school books during the first five months of its operation,
                  working seven or eight hours a day. Writing home on 4 December
                  1817, he noted:

                    persons whose business is to enquire when the books will be
                    ready: and an increasing desire to become acquainted with
                    the word of God, powerfully pervades the minds of the
                    people.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  A 24 page translation of the Gospel of Luke was soon prepared
                  for printing, with paper supplied by the British and Foreign
                  Bible Society.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In mid-November 1817, six additional British missionaries
                  arrived at Tahiti, including Lancelot Threlkeld, who had left
                  England with Ellis but was held up in Rio de Janeiro due to
                  the illness of his family. Also among the new recruits was
                  John Williams, who would become a celebrated missionary martyr
                  decades later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In May 1818, the time that LMS supporters gathered annually
                  for missionary week in London, Pomare II established a
                  Tahitian Auxiliary Missionary Society to collect donations of
                  coconut oil, pigs, arrowroot and cotton to enable the
                  expansion of missionary work beyond Tahiti.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In early July of that year, with the Gospel of Luke printed in
                  Tahitian and bound copies distributed among the missionaries,
                  Ellis loaded the printing press onto the <em>Haweis,</em> a
                  locally built missionary ship, and sailed for the island of
                  Huahine. He was initially accompanied by Williams and
                  Threlkeld, but in September the pair relocated to the
                  neighbouring island of Raiatea, a Polynesian ceremonial centre
                  widely recognised across the Pacific.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By 1822, the Church at Huahine was well established and intent
                  on sending its own missionaries to resume the aborted mission
                  to the Marquesas Islands, a thousand miles to the north-east.
                  A religious meeting ofaround 1200 people in the island’s large
                  chapel selected two volunteers. Auna, a nobleman and former
                  priest of Raiatea, now a deacon of the Huahine church,
                  volunteered to take the ‘good word of God’ –
                  <em>parau maitai nate atua</em> – together with his wife, who
                  the congregation agreed would teach the women ‘to make their
                  own dresses, plait straw bonnets’ in order ‘to clothe

                  Captain Kent of the <em>Mermaid</em> agreed to provide the
                  volunteers with free passage, either on his way to Hawai’i or
                  on the return voyage. Auna, Mattatore and their wives were
                  accompanied by William Ellis, as well as Daniel Tyerman and
                  George Bennet, who were visiting Huahine at the time, together
                  with their ‘personal servants’, engaged at Huahine (including
                  one named Purahah).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Tyerman, a minister from the Isle of Wight, and Bennet, a lay
                  supporter of missions from Sheffield in Yorkshire, were known
                  as ‘the Deputation’ – sent by their fellow Directors of the
                  London Missionary Society on a journey of inspection around
                  the globe:
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                    to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the state of
                    the missions, and of the islands; and to suggest, and, if
                    possible, carry into effect, such plans as shall appear to
                    be requisite for the furtherance of the gospel, and for
                    introducing among the natives the occupations and habits of
                    civilised life.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The Directors were apparently more concerned with ‘the
                  occupations and habits of civilised life’ than many of the
                  missionaries. A few years earlier they had sent John Gyles
                  with equipment for processing sugar cane to Tahiti – he had
                  previously been an overseer in Jamaica. According to
                  amissionary account compiled at Tahiti:
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                    Both Mr G and the Directors of the Missionary Society
                    appeared to have wrong views on the subject. They thought as
                    the people had embraced Christianity, they would at once see
                    the propriety of productive plans of industry that might be
                    proposed to them and at once adopt all that might be
                    proposed advantageous from the circumstances of climate
                    &amp;c such as the Culture of the sugar Cane, Cotton, Coffee
                    &amp;c and Mr G having been in the West Indies, and
                    witnessing the cheapness of labour by means of negroes
                    thought the natives of these islands might be induced to
                    labour in the same way. But he soon found he had free and
                    independent people to deal with, and the more of command and
                    authority he used toward them, the less they were disposed

                  In August 1819, after an unsuccessful and ultimately
                  unproductive year, Gyles left with his family for Australia.
                  Undeterred, in May 1821, the Directors despatched two further
                  missionary artisans and their families to Tahiti along with
                  Tyerman, Bennet and another missionary recruit with all the
                  equipment for spinning and weaving cotton in a British whaling
                  ship. As well as a crew of 35 and a surgeon, the passengers
                  also included a 25 year old Tahitian who had been baptised
                  with the name Robert.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Arriving at Matavai Bay in late September 1821, the Deputation
                  began an engagement with the Society’s mission stations that
                  would last until Bennet finally returned to Britain in June
                  1829. The visit to Hawai’i was unplanned, but provided an
                  opportunity to meet the missionaries who had arrived there in
                  March 1820, sent by the USA’s counterpart to the LMS, the
                  American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions,
                  established in 1810.

                  After leaving Huahine, north-easterly winds saw the
                  <em>Mermaid</em> bypass the Marquesas. Her crew and passengers
                  were no less cosmopolitan than the fictional whaling
                  <em>Pequod</em>, immortalised in Herman Melville’s 1851 novel
                  <em>Moby Dick</em>. When an orphaned Australian aboriginal boy
                  fell overboard, he was saved by Tyerman and Bennet’s Tahitian
                  attendants, who dived into the sea, a rope tied around their
                  waists – a feat that was performed by Queequeg, the Polynesian
                  harpooner of Melville’s whaling tale.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  The first Hawaiian to meet the party at Kawaihae Bay was John

                  in the archipelago, and younger brother of the Queen Regent
                  Ka’ahumanu. Kuakini, who had learned English from Americans
                  visitors and adopted the name of the second American
                  President, was dressed in a jacket and trousers.

                  The following day, the <em>Mermaid</em> was visited by a
                  number of more ordinary Hawaiians in canoes, described by
                  Tyerman and Bennet as ‘very scantily attired, and very
                  slovenly in their manners’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  When the deputation went ashore the following day, they
                  encountered women wearing’no covering except a slight cloth
                  about their loins’ but some were ‘superbly tattooed’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later, they met a high status woman with a ‘remarkably modest’
                  demeanour, wearing ‘a scarlet woollen under-dress of European
                  manufacture, and an upper robe of fine native-cloth’, set off
                  with a necklace of black beads from which a whale’s tooth
                  ornament was suspended, while ‘over her bosom, also, was slung
                  a small looking-glass’ by a slip of brown list.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Others, such as a priest wearing an English shirt, were
                  regarded as ‘preposterous’.

                <p>
                  Visiting the house of a chief, Tyerman and Bennet were
                  surprised to find a print hanging on the wall showing a
                  Hawaiian man and woman taken from the 1784 published account
                  of Cook’s third voyage. The man depicted was Kana’ina, also
                  known as Kalaimanokaho’owaha, a chief who was killed along
                  with Cook, while the woman was his wife Poeta, presumably
                  relatives if not ancestors of the householder.

                  Writing in their journal, the deputation couldn’t help
                  comparing what they encountered at Kawaihae Bay to the
                  situation in the Society Islands, where they had spent most of
                  the previous six months:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Here, where the gospel as yet has done but little in its
                    spiritual effects, we were taught to estimate, more truly
                    than we could even upon the spot, how much it has done in
                    the Society Islands. The contrast was powerful, and it was
                    saddening; yet not without hope.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Tyerman and Bennet were not the only ones scandalised by the
                  ‘disgusting scantiness’ of ordinary female Hawaiian dress, it
                  seems. When Hawaiian women visited the <em>Mermaid</em> after
                  it had anchored at Kealekekua Bay and admired the bonnets and
                  dresses of the female Tahitians, according to the deputation’s
                  journal, the Tahitians:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    took the opportunity frankly to reprove them for appearing
                    with so little clothing on; assuring them that in the
                    southern islands, no modest woman durst go out of doors so
                    unbecomingly exposed. They added, moreover, “and we will not
                    acknowledge you to be women if you do not dress more
                    decently.” The dialects of the both nations are so nearly
                    akin that the natives can converse very well with one
                    another.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  the large <em>marae</em> (ceremonial enclosure), where two
                  twelve foot high carved posts still stood on the stone walls
                  at the north-east side, ‘across the middle of each of which

                  Conversion seems to have meant different things to different
                  people. In most cases change was expressed through the
                  adoption, but at times also the construction, of new kinds of
                  artefacts. Kamehameha I evidently wanted a ship, complete with
                  guns, to make him the equal of the European leaders who had
                  visited the islands since the time of Captain Cook. John Adams
                  Kuakini adopted modern dress and took an American name, just
                  as other high status Hawaiians wore items of imported
                  clothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Converted women from the Society Islands, however, emphasised
                  respectability over novelty in dress, as well as their own
                  capacity to make dresses and bonnets to clothe themselves. It
                  is likely that the dresses they referred to were
                  <em>tiputa</em>, ponchos made locally from bark cloth that
                  covered the upper part of the body and became widely
                  associated with conversion to Christianity across the
                  Pacific.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The Directors of the London Missionary Society, however, were
                  chiefly concerned with modern forms of work and productivity.
                  The manufacturing processes of the sugar plantation and cotton
                  mill expressed what Max Weber would later call the
                  <em>The Protestant Work Ethic</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  in material form, but as committed abolitionists, they
                  believed wage labour should ultimately replace the forced
                  labour of enslaved people as the productive force on which so
                  much commodity production depended.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For European missionaries, perhaps unsurprisingly, a central
                  marker of conversion was support for and ultimately adoption
                  of missionary activity by the converted. The collection and
                  donation of gifts to support missionary work, as well as the
                  construction of chapels where missionary meetings could be
                  held, were seen to demonstrate the evangelical orientations of
                  Christian converts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Auna, as a deacon of the church at Huahine, when volunteering
                  to become a missionary himself, spoke of the ‘good word of
                  God’. It seems that for many Pacific islanders this was
                  represented by the written word, but perhaps more precisely
                  the printed word: Polynesian words converted to marks that
                  were impressed onto paper by the mission printing press.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the press was a mechanical device – like a sugar press,
                  or cotton mill – through which labour was transformed into new
                  kinds of artefacts, the attitude that Polynesians took towards
                  the paper on which the press imprinted the word of god does
                  not seem to have been immaterial to the importance they
                  afforded to books, and to the Bible, as the word of God in
                  particular.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Europeans such as Tyerman and Bennet, it was natural to
                  think of the items they saw Polynesians wearing as made from
                  native cloth, but the <em>tapa</em> of the Tahitians and
                  <em>kapa</em> of the Hawaiians was not cloth in a typical
                  European sense. Rather than being woven on a loom from fibre
                  strands that form a warp and a weft, it is formed from bark
                  fibres beaten to make them flat and flexible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In its material form, bark cloth with its interlocking strands
                  of horizontally oriented fibres, is rather more like paper
                  than a woven textile. In Tahiti, high quality
                  <em>tapa</em> was commonly bleached white, with patterns
                  printed onto it to enhance its appearance. In Hawai’i, the
                  process of printing patterns onto bark cloth was called
                  <em>palapala</em>, a word that would be extended, first to the
                  printing of words onto paper, and later to new forms of
                  education in general.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We might dismiss the concerns of European missionaries with
                  ‘scantily clad’ Hawaiians as a consequence of puritanical
                  sexual morality, but we shouldn’t dismiss the material
                  connection between conversion, new ways of covering the body
                  and the widespread circulation of printed texts. There is a
                  Polynesian logic by which clothes elevate and enhance the
                  bodies of their wearers, making it unsurprising that at
                  Kealakekua Bay it was the nobles or <em>ali’i</em> of Hawai’i
                  who were wearing rather more about their bodies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This concern with wrapping and marking the body, also
                  expressed through tattooing, aligns in certain ways with
                  missionary preoccupations with dress as an indicator of
                  modesty and respectability. The marking of status and rank
                  through forms of dress was common to both Atlantic and Pacific
                  societies, and it seems that clothing, cloth but also paper,
                  formed a zone of recognition where common values could be
                  negotiated and established.

                  On 11 April 1822, the <em>Mermaid</em> sailed from Kealekekua
                  Bay to Oahu in the hope of locating the Prince Regent. Bennet
                  and Tyerman accompanied Captain Kent when he was presented to
                  the King, Kamehameha II, who was pleased to learn of his gift,
                  mainly, it seems, because it promised to cement a political
                  allegiance with the British monarchy (he already had ten other
                  ships by this time).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The young king, when first encountered, was wearing a shirt,
                  jacket, waistcoat and pantaloons, accompanied by five wives
                  who were wearing silken girdles with necklaces of flowers and
                  fern wreaths on their heads. The assembled party toasted the
                  King’s health with European wine, but Tyerman and Bennet
                  couldn’t help noticing the attendant who fanned him
                  continuously with long white feathers, while one of his wives
                  occasionally proffered a wooden dish for the king to spit

                  Captain Kent was given accommodation by the King, but Tyerman,
                  Bennet and Ellis were welcomed by the American Missionaries. A
                  Tahitian attendant of Queen Regent Ka’ahumanu arrived to ask
                  that his fellow countrymen be allowed to stay with the Kuhina
                  Nui’s household. It turned out that he was actually the
                  brother of Auna’s wife, who had left Tahiti as a boy, 30 years
                  previously. Auna and his wife were adopted into this extremely
                  powerful Hawaiian household, instituting morning and evening
                  prayers and teaching their companions about the new religion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ellis found that his Tahitian enabled him to to make himself
                  understood, and when he preached in the language at the
                  American chapel, the sermon was attended by an array of
                  Hawaiian nobles, Liholiho seated at their centre. Tyerman and
                  Bennet compared the event to the preaching of Paul to the
                  Athenians, recorded in the Acts of the Apostles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  They noted, however, that it was the appearance, dress and
                  conversation of the Tahitian Christians that most impressed
                  the assembled Hawaiians. Ka’ahumanu evidently spent a great
                  deal of time in conversation with Auna’s wife about Tahitian
                  politics and the changes brought by the new religion, while
                  the Tahitian women used their sewing skills to make new
                  clothes for the Queen Regent. Auna spent a good deal of his
                  time instructing her husband, Kaumuali’i, King of the island
                  of Kaua’i (marked Tauai on the map above).

                <p>
                  From their base at Honolulu, Tyerman and Bennet observed the
                  royal trade in sandalwood, which saw this locally plentiful
                  commodity traded to China in American ships. Witnessing two
                  thousand people carrying a vast load to the coast, they
                  suggested that the condition of the common people of Hawai’i
                  was akin to slavery – ‘they hold nothing which may not be
                  taken from them by the strong hand of arbitrary power’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Elsewhere they marvelled at the surf boards,
                  <em>papahorua</em>, in people’s homes, ‘eight or ten feet
                  long, wider at one end than the other, and convex on both
                  sides’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  They also met a Spaniard who had lived on the island for
                  thirty years, as well as a Black American consulted for his
                  healing skills by Hawaiians as well as visiting sailors.

                  Allen, as he was called, had established a compound for
                  himself near Waikiki with a flock of two hundred goats that he
                  sold to visiting ships, a large number of dogs that he sold to
                  Hawaiians for feasts, as well as a profitable business selling
                  liquor. While Tyerman and Bennet rejoiced in the prosperity of
                  this ‘poor African’, they nevertheless disapproved of his
                  activities, particularly since selling alcohol was most
                  profitable on Sundays, when sailors were allowed ashore.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  On 1 May, <em>The Prince Regent</em> was formally presented to
                  the King, but when Captain Kent prepared to lower the British
                  colours, Liholiho said he would continue to fly them – perhaps
                  suggesting an origin for the Hawaiian flag. Having spent a
                  month in the Sandwich Isles, the missionaries expected to
                  resume their journey to the Marquesas in <em>The Mermaid</em>,
                  but were informed by Captain Kent that he would sail to
                  Fanning Island (Tauaeran) to buy <em>béche de mer</em> to sell
                  in China, but would return later to collect them.

                  Finding themselves at a loose end in Honolulu, Tyerman and
                  Bennet attempted to persuade the King to formally adopt
                  Christianity. Visiting the royal women, they found them
                  dressed in a mixture of European and Hawaiian clothing, some
                  wearing silk and calico gowns with feather tippets, while
                  others wore scarlet cloth about their loins with necklaces
                  made from plaited human hair and whale’s tooth pendants.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Extremely valuable, one of these was later presented to the
                  Missionary Museum by William Ellis.

                  Tyerman and Bennet were told that Liholiho’s decision to
                  overturn the existing religious system had been partly
                  prompted by the reports of Hawaiians returning from Britain,
                  America and Australia, where their gods were not worshipped.
                  When Hawaiian priests stated that abandoning the
                  <em>maraes</em> wouldprevent the rain from falling, Joseph
                  Banks, a young man named after CaptainCook’s companion,
                  pointed out to that there was plenty of rain in England
                  andAmerica, as there was in Tahiti after Pomare destroyed the
                  idols.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Other ‘modernists’ such as John Adams Kuakini found that
                  despite offering 40 sacrificial pigs when directed to do so by
                  priests, he did not recover from his illness. Even Kamehameha
                  I, towards the end of his reign, evidently refused to cast a
                  large herd of pigs into the sea to appease the angry spirit
                  that the priests told him was responsible for volcanic
                  eruptions on Hawai’i.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 10 May, Auna approached Tyerman and Bennet with a request
                  from Ka’ahumanu – that the Tahitians be allowed to stay at
                  Hawai’i, with William Ellis as their overseeing
                  missionary.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  This led Tyerman and Bennet to interpret their prolonged stay
                  in Hawai’i as an act of divine intervention and this request
                  was agreed to by Ellis, the American Missionaries, as well as
                  by Liholiho, who like Pomare in Tahiti asked that he be the
                  first in his kingdom to receive instruction in the new
                  religion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Waiting for the return of <em>The Mermaid</em>, Tyerman and
                  Bennet toured the island of Oahu where they witnessed four
                  noblewomen printing flowers and ornamental figures onto
                  <em>kapa</em> cloth, using designs engraved onto thin pieces
                  of bamboo:

                    This work is executed with considerable expedition as well
                    as accuracy; and, if not borrowed from the suggestions of
                    European visitors (which is hardly probable), it may be said
                    that <em>printing</em>, as well as <em>engraving</em>, are
                    original inventions of the Sandwich islanders, both being
                    used in this ingenious process.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Ellis seems to have largely spent this time improving his
                  Hawaiian – by August he had composed four hymns in the
                  language and was using it to preach two or three times a week.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Auna, on the other hand, was immediately taken on a tour of
                  the islands by Ka’ahumanu. His journal, translated by Ellis,
                  suggests that by 12 May he was at Lahaina on Maui, where the
                  Queen Regent was presented with over 50 bundles of kapa cloth,
                  as well as large quantities of dogs and poi for feasting. On
                  17 May, they sailed to tour Hawai’i, Auna preaching each
                  day.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fn31" id="page-chapter-7-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 4 June, Ka’ahumanu sent for one of Kamehameha I’s ‘idols’,
                  named ‘<em>Teraipahoa’</em>, which together with nine smaller
                  idols were publicly burnt. During the morning of 24 June,
                  following a day spent surfing and praying, a man fetched eight
                  ‘idols’ named
                  <em>Teraipahoa, Tetonemotu, Paparahaamau, Hatuahia, Kaunaruura,
                    Maiora</em>
                  and <em>Akuahanai.</em> These were supposed to be taken to
                  Liholiho in Oahu, but were instead burnt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 26 June, John Adams Kuakini kindled a major fire in which
                  he burnt 102 ‘idols’. According to Auna’s journal, this made
                  him think of the burnings initiated at Papetoai on Moorea by
                  the priest Patii, ‘and with my heart I praised Jehovah, the
                  true God, that I now saw these people following our
                  example’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  It is surely signifiant that just as at Tahiti, European
                  missionaries were not involved when these acts of iconoclasm
                  took place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Back in Oahu, Liholiho told Tyerman and Bennet that he
                  intended to learn the new <em>palapala</em>, and began
                  learning the Hawaiian hymns composed by Ellis. Soon
                  afterwards, however, he was disapprovingly noted to be
                  spending the day drinking and dancing the hula.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  On 29 July, <em>The Mermaid</em> finally returned to Oahu, but
                  rather than preparing to leave for Huahine, Auna and his wife
                  left soon afterwards on a tour of the archipelago’s leeward
                  islands with Ka’ahumanu and a retinue of 1200 people.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Tyerman, Bennet, Ellis, Matatore and his wife left Honolulu in
                  <em>The Mermaid</em> on 22 August 1822. After a difficult
                  voyage, they landed at the island of Rurutu in late September,
                  350 miles south of Huahine. Approaching the island they made
                  out ‘neat-looking white houses, built in the English
                  fashion’(493) and on landing they found two Raiatean
                  missionaries, Mahamene and Puna, overseeing the construction
                  of a chapel.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fn35" id="page-chapter-7-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  Their mission to the island had commenced in July the previous
                  year, the first undertaken without European oversight.
                  Attending a service at which Ellis preached, they found the
                  balustrade of the pulpit staircase had been made from
                  discarded spears.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>The Mermaid</em> finally returned to Huahine in early
                  October, much to the relief of Ellis’ family, who had become
                  convinced in the eight months he had been away that he had
                  died at the hands of pirates – a ship of whom had found their
                  way to Huahine in his absence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having witnessed the effectiveness of Auna’s work in Hawai’i,
                  as well as of Mahamene and Puna at Rurutu, Tyerman and Bennet
                  wereconvinced of the need to establish a seminary to educate
                  Polynesians toundertake missionary work. A meeting of
                  missionaries was called on the islandof Raiatea to discuss
                  this, as well as the proposed removal of Ellis and hisfamily
                  to Hawai’i.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Taking a walk at the end of the day, Tyerman and Bennet noted
                  ‘increasing evidences of enterprise and industry, of peace and
                  plenty, of social order and religious principle.’ A key
                  observation seems to have been that the island’s women were
                  seen wearing bonnets on which there were ‘bows of ribbon, of
                  different tints and curious patterns, some of which were
                  exceedingly rich’. Asked how they had acquired these
                  impressive items, they were told they had been made from bark
                  cloth, inspired by a ribbon awarded to a girl at a missionary
                  school.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fn36" id="page-chapter-7-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>

                  On 31 December 1822, Ellis left for Hawai’i with his family

                  well as Taamotu, a female teacher.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Arriving in Honolulu on 5 February 1823, they rejoined Auna
                  and the American missionaries in their efforts to complete the
                  conversion of the Hawaiian archipelago. Taua, together with
                  his family were adopted into the household of Keōpūolani, the

                  In April of the same year, a second company of American
                  missionaries arrived at Honolulu, and in July William Ellis
                  joined Asa Thurston, one of the leaders of the first company
                  of missionaries, as well as new arrivals Artemas Bishop and
                  Joseph Goodrich, to tour the island of Hawai’i to find
                  suitable locations for additional mission stations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fascinated by the island’s active volcanic geology, they
                  climbed to the summit of the volcano Kīlauea, to the
                  consternation of their guide, Makoa, a King’s messenger.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  At Waiakea they were confronted by a priestess of the goddess
                  of the volcano, Pélé, but to the surprise of the missionaries
                  she was challenged by Makoa who told her she was little more
                  than a source of mischief. Returning to Kailua Bay, they
                  witnessed John Adams Kuakini building a large chapel with
                  stones taken from the old <em>marae</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Returning home to Honolulu on 10 September, Ellis found the
                  chapel had been burned down, presumably as an act of protest
                  at the changes Christianity was bringing to the islands. He
                  was soon summoned to Lahaina, to the deathbed of Keōpūolani,
                  mother of Liholiho. Conducting the service in Hawaiian, he
                  baptised the Queen the day before she died, making her the
                  first Hawaiian noble to receive the Christian rite. Keōpūolani
                  evidently asked for a Christian burial. A sketch which was
                  subsequently made into a print that featured on the cover of
                  <em>Missionary Sketches</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fn41" id="page-chapter-7-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The accompanying text describes the Queen’s close relationship
                  with Taua from Huahine, whom she consulted when confronted by
                  chiefs who pointed out that while reading and writing were
                  good things, the people of India did these ‘yet they keep
                  their gods of wood and stone just as they always did’.⁠

                  In November 1823, Kamehameha II decided to visit the British
                  Isles himself, commissioning a British whaling ship,
                  <em>L’Aigle</em>, to take them to London. Its captain, a young
                  American by the name of Valentine Starbuck agreed to take
                  Liholiho and a party of 10 Hawaiian nobles, but refused to
                  take William Ellis as their translator and guide.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Stopping at Rio de Janeiro, Kamehameha II met Emperor Pedro I
                  of Brazil to whom he gave a feather cloak or
                  <em>‘ahu ‘ula</em>, receiving a diamond-encrusted sword in
                  return.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arriving in England in May 1824, the party waited a month to
                  see George IV. They were shown the sites of London, attending
                  the opera in Covent Garden and the Theatre Royal, but Liholiho
                  refused to enter Westminster Abbey lest he desecrate the royal
                  burial place. A number of the Hawaiians unfortunately
                  contracted the measles and Queen Kamāmalu sadly died in London
                  on 8 July 1824, followed by King Kamehameha II six days later.

                  Back in Hawai’i, the ongoing illness of Mary Ellis made the
                  family’s return to England increasingly urgent. In September
                  1824 they were offered passage on an American whaler to New
                  England. Arriving at New Bedford in March 1825, William Ellis
                  spent four months speaking to American congregations from a
                  base in Boston.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is presumably for this reason that versions of Ellis’
                  drawings found their way into two volumes published in Boston
                  in that year. The first is a
                  <em>Memoir of Keopuolani, Late Queen of the Sandwich
                    Islands</em>, published in June, which features two images that contrast
                  a scene of Hawaiian ‘wailing’ on the arrival of Kuakini with
                  the Christian burial subsequently conducted for the Queen.

                  <em>A Journal of a Tour Around Hawaii, the largest of the
                    Sandwich Islands</em>, the text of which was compiled by William Ellis. This
                  included portraits of Kuakini (featured above), Makoa as well
                  as depictions of the royal burial site, a missionary
                  preaching, and the volcanic crater at Kirauea.

                  Eventually sailing from New York in late July, the Ellis
                  family arrived in England in August 1825, three months after
                  the remains of Liholiho and his queen had returned to Hawai’i.
                  With nine years missionary experience in the Pacific, William
                  Ellis became extremely valuable to the London Missionary
                  Society, who immediately sent him to speak at missionary
                  meetings across the British Isles.

                <p>
                  As a missionary account, the publication of Ellis’
                  <em>Narrative</em> followed that of the voyage of the
                  <em>Duff</em> (1799) as well as the two accounts of African
                  journeys by John Campbell (1815, 1822). Ellis, however, had
                  been a much longer-term resident in the places he wrote about.
                  Beginning his account with a consideration of the narrative of
                  Captain Cook’s third voyage, with which Hawai’i was
                  indissolubly connected in the English mind, he suggested this
                  had led many readers to imagine the islands were:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    a sort of elysium, where the highly-favoured
                    inhabitants,free from the toil and care, the want and
                    disappointments, which mar the happiness of civilised
                    communities, dwelt in what they called a state of nature,
                    and spent their lives in unrestrained gratification and
                    enjoyment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fn45" id="page-chapter-7-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  While these accounts may have been ‘faithful transcripts ofthe
                  first impressions’ made on the minds of Cook and his
                  companions, Ellis suggested they were correct only ‘so far as
                  their partial observation extended’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  He argued that the arrival of ships and foreigners had been so
                  important and surprising an event that ordinary life was for a
                  time suspended – the whole island being dedicated to supplying
                  the every need of the visiting sailors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ellis suggested that the acquaintance of the previous
                  generation with the islands and their people had ultimately
                  been superficial in comparison to the eight years he had spent
                  living in the Pacific, leading them into mistaken inferences.
                  Far different, he suggested were the impressions produced on
                  the minds of the missionaries who have resided for some years
                  in the islands, acquired the language and observed nearly all
                  aspects of life, government and religion.

                  Nearly a century before the publication of Malinowski’s
                  <em>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</em>, William Ellis used
                  the length of his stay and his linguistic abilities to
                  establish his literary authority as an observer of Pacific
                  life. He also used images, as well as artefacts, acquired
                  during his travels, to buttress the text. Ellis used footnotes
                  to refer the reader to specimens of lava and rocks (1826:
                  228), as well as:

                  While the published accounts of Tyerman, Bennet and Ellis
                  suggest that Hawaiians were actively and enthusiastically
                  acquiring, as well as emulating modern forms of clothing in
                  the early 1820s, these visitors were clearly equally
                  fascinated by the bark cloth produced in the islands,
                  collecting examples to take to take home to Europe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The footnote, cited above, from which this chapter takes its
                  title, comes at the end of a fairly extended description of
                  bark cloth manufacture that Ellis incorporated into his
                  account of the 1823 tour of Hawai’i. Having seen people
                  carrying bundles of branches of <em>wauke</em> (paper mulberry
                  or <em>Broussoneia papyrifera</em>), six to ten feet long and
                  an inch in diameter, the missionaries watched on the morning
                  of 17 July 1823 as Keoua, the wife of John Adams Kuakini,
                  worked these with her attendants and about 40 other women in
                  the shade of a grove of trees:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    They first cut the bark, the whole length of the stick,
                    witha sharp serrated shell, and having carefully peeled it
                    off, rolled it into small coils, the inner bark being
                    outside. In this state it is left some time,to make it flat
                    and smooth. Keoa not only worked herself, but appears to
                    take the superintendence of the whole party. Whenever a fine
                    piece of bark was found, it was shown to her, and put aside
                    to be manufactured into <em>wairiirii,</em> or some other
                    particular cloth. With lively chat and cheerful song, they

                  While this is all that is recorded in the account published in
                  Boston in 1825, Ellis used this episode to include several
                  further pages of description of the cultivation of
                  <em>wauke</em> as well as the manufacturing process, listing
                  the types of cloth made and comparing these to muslin, dimity,
                  and wash-leather in the expanded 1826 version.

                  He described how red and yellow painted examples were rubbed
                  with vegetable oil, perfumed with chips of sandal wood or the
                  seeds of <em>pandanusodoratissima</em>, to make them water
                  resistant. <em>Kapa moe</em> was a type of sleeping cloth,
                  coloured white, yellow, brown or black and made from several
                  layers of <em>kapa</em> for the chiefs, while
                  <em>kihei</em> was made in the same way but only the size of a
                  shawl, commonly coloured white or yellow mixed with red and
                  black and worn by men over one shoulder:

                    But the best kind of cloth made with the cultivated plant is
                    the <em>wairiirii</em>, which is made into <em>paüs</em> for
                    the females and <em>maros</em> for the men. The paüs are
                    generally fouryards long, and about one yard wide, very
                    thick, beautifully pained with brilliant red, yellow, and
                    black colours, and covered over with a fine gum and resinous
                    varnish, which not only preserves the colours, but renders
                    the cloth impervious and durable. The <em>maros</em> are
                    about a foot wide and three or four yards long.

                    The colours they employ are procured from the leaves, bark,
                    berries, or roots of indigenous plants, and require much
                    skill in their preparation. One or two kinds of earth are
                    also used in mixing the darker colours. Since foreigners
                    have visited them, they have found, upon trial, that our
                    colours are better than theirs, and the paint they purchase

                  Describing the techniques of printing using engraved bamboo,
                  Ellis was keen that his readers appreciate the ingenuity and
                  skill involved in <em>kapa</em> production:
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                    whether we consider its different textures, its varied and
                    regular patterns, its beautiful colours, so admirably
                    preserved by means of the varnish, we are at once convinced,
                    that the people who manufacture it are neither deficient in
                    taste, nor incapable of receiving the improvements of
                    civilised society.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fn50" id="page-chapter-7-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>

                  At this point in the text, the footnote referred readers to
                  examples in the Missionary Museum in order that they could
                  convince themselves of the quality, industry and invention of
                  cloth production with their own eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The framing of this observation is significant, using the
                  skill inherent in existing forms of production to exemplify
                  the potential for conversion and civilisation. There were many
                  in British society who opposed missionary activity on a number
                  of different grounds, but Ellis seems keen to evoke
                  artefactual evidence to refute those who would claim that
                  there was no point in undertaking missionary work among people
                  incapable of improving themselves.

                  In the 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum, published in
                  the same year as Ellis’ account, we find further items that
                  are mentioned in his text. As well as the specimens of lava
                  and examples of cloth, other items listed from the ‘Sandwich
                  Islands’ include baskets used for keeping cloth (1826: 293), a
                  decorated calabash (1826: 349), a <em>páhe</em> or dart used
                  for gaming (1826: 169), as well as a pair of shoes made from
                  bull’s hide, worn by Ellis on his tour (1826: 76). The
                  catalogue also lists a dedicated display case:

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    containing a great variety of Articles, brought over by the
                    Rev. W. Ellis, most of which have a description attached to
                    them. For a longer account see his work lately
                    published.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-7-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-7-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Other items listed in the 1826 catalogue from the Sandwich
                  Islands include two walking sticks, a shell blown to call
                  people to school and worship at Oahu, two pieces of wood for
                  making fire and a small drum.

                  Only one ‘idol’ from Hawai’i was listed – a feathered head ‘in
                  a glass case… formerly in Parkinson’s Museum’. This was the
                  Leverian collection, acquired by Parkinson through a lottery
                  in 1786, but sold at auction in 1806. It seems very likely,
                  then, that this was acquired in Hawai’i on Captain Cook’s
                  third voyage. Who presented it to the Missionary Museum is
                  unknown.

                  Further material, including the large wooden figure from the
                  <em>marae</em> at Kairua Bay would eventually find its way to
                  London with George Bennet later, and a note was added to the
                  catalogue in expectation of this:

                    articles, on the return of the Deputation. Additional

                  In 1921, eleven years after the museum of the London
                  Missionary Society had closed and a hundred years after
                  Tyerman and Bennet arrived in the Pacific, the British Museum
                  recorded a donation of eighteen samples bark cloth from the
                  London Missionary Society. They arrived with virtually no
                  information about where they were originally from.

                  Given that many have been identified on stylistic grounds as
                  Hawaiian, it seems very likely that this collection
                  constitutes what remains of the specimens referred to by Ellis
                  in 1826. Today they offer us a fascinating glimpse into
                  Hawaiian society at a crucial moment of political and
                  religious transformation. Nevertheless, like William Ellis two
                  centuries ago, Ican’t help being impressed by their visual
                  beauty and the considerable skill they manifest.

                <p>
                  Rumours of a ‘Goth-like army’ of fearsome ‘Mantatees’ ran
                  through the Tswana towns of South Africa’s interior for
                  months. Tales told of people from the southeast with long hair
                  and dark skins wielding sickle-like weapons, terrifying many
                  who heard them. At first Robert Moffat, a young Scottish
                  missionary, dismissed these tales as ‘mere fabrications’, but
                  over time evidence accumulated that the so-called ‘Mantatees’
                  were rather more than figments of the imagination.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moffat finally came face-to-face with a large group of these
                  semi-mythical people on 25 June 1823, gathered outside the
                  town of Old Lattakoo (Dithakong), in what is now South
                  Africa’s Northern Cape. He spoke with an elderly man and his
                  son who were part of the group, resting in the shade of a
                  rock. They claimed to be dying of hunger and begged for meat.
                  When the larger group became aware of the missionary, and
                  perhaps more significantly the 12 armed Griqua men on
                  horseback who accompanied him, they surrounded their herd of
                  cattle for protection. Griqua scouts approached the group, but
                  were greeted with a yell, followed by a hail of weapons.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reinforced by a larger commando from Griqua Town (Klaarwater)
                  the following day, another approach at sunrise met with the
                  same response. At this point Andries Waterboer, the Kaptijn or
                  leader at Griqua Town, began to shoot. Counter-attacks were
                  made, but Moffat recorded in his journal that the enemy were
                  reluctant to be parted from their cattle. Women mixed with men
                  in the defence of the herds, with Moffat complaining that this
                  made it impossible to avoid shooting them.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After two and a half hours of battle with a mounted Griqua
                  commando of around 100 supported by Bathlaping warriors firing
                  poisoned arrows, ‘the Mantatees’, on foot and armed with only
                  spears, clubs and axes, attempted to retreat. They made their
                  way into the town which they set alight, perhaps in the hope
                  of creating a distraction. The Griqua, however, pursued the
                  retreating group for eight miles, capturing over 1000 head of
                  cattle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moffat recorded that between 400 and 500 ‘Mantatees’ were
                  killed during seven hours of fighting, with only one Tswana
                  combatant killed ‘perhaps from too much boldness in
                  plunder’.⁠⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fn4" id="page-chapter-8-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  The disparity in casualties makes it clear how decisive an
                  advantage firearms and horses gave to the Griqua, compared
                  with other groups operating in the African interior.

                  Moffat’s eyewitness account of what has become known as ‘the
                  Battle of Dithakong’, written in his journal but published in
                  abridged form in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> soon after,
                  in January 1824, is somewhat ambivalent.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  He attempts to position himself as witness and bystander, but
                  acknowledges that he was responsible for requesting the
                  assistance of the Griqua when told of approaching ‘Mantatees’,
                  as well as for supplying them with gunpowder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moffat remained with the Griqua commando for his own safety,
                  but was, by his own admission, far from being in command of
                  these rather expert fighters. He claims not to have discharged
                  a single shot ‘as fighting was not my province’, but remained
                  implicated in the violent confrontation that unfolded as he
                  watched.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having worried about the shooting of women, he evidently
                  became even more upset when Batlhaping warriors joined the
                  fray, killing wounded men, women and children with spears and
                  axes ’like voracious wolves’ with ‘savage ferocity… and
                  severing the head from the body, for the sake of a few paltry
                  rings’. Moffat states that he galloped among them to prevent
                  this slaughter, inducing many women to sit on the ground, bare
                  their breasts and cry ‘we are women’.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Moffat and the only other European present, John Melvill, a
                  former government surveyor at the Cape who had given up a
                  healthy salary to become a government agent at Griqua Town
                  (and would later resign this post to become an LMS
                  missionary), took responsibility for ‘collecting the
                  prisoners’, mostly women and children, after the main body of
                  Griquas ‘galloped forward, anxious to divide the spoil’ – the
                  large herd of captured cattle. At this point, Moffat used
                  italics to remark in his journal: ‘<em>They are heathens still</em>’.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Spoils of battle were not confined to cattle, however, and
                  Moffat noted that the path taken by the retreating enemy was
                  ‘thickly strewed with karosses, victuals, utensils, ornaments,
                  and weapons, which the Bechuanas eagerly gathered up’.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  If Moffat was merely a witness to these scenes of plunder, as
                  his journal implies, how did a number of items apparently
                  taken at the battle, including ‘a Mantatese apron’, find their
                  way to the Missionary Museum in London, and from there to the
                  British Museum where they remain today?

                  The Battle of Dithakong has come to assume a central place in
                  historical understandings of a period violence, disruption and
                  significant population displacement that unfolded across the
                  interior of southern Africa during the 1820s, known widely as
                  the <em>mfecane</em> or <em>difaqane</em> (depending on which
                  southern Bantu language grouping is preferred). Eyewitness

                  After battles later in the century that saw both British
                  troops and Boer voortrekkers on the losing side against Zulu
                  regiments, historians widely connected the conflicts and
                  migrations of the 1820s to the rise of the Zulu kingdom on
                  South Africa’s southeast coast, under its most charismatic
                  King, Shaka. If the history of the world was the biography of
                  great men, then Shaka became a conquering African hero in the
                  form most admired by Thomas Carlyle (1840) – a South African
                  Napoleon.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In 1966, John Omer-Cooper, based for over a decade at the
                  University of Ibadan in Nigeria where historians were
                  attempting to write African history for its own sake as the
                  country embraced independence, published
                  <em>The Zulu Aftermath</em>, a synthetic work that attempted
                  to Africanise South African history.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  According to one of his contemporaries, Omer-Cooper ‘sought to
                  restore the dignity of Africans as positive actors in their
                  history’.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Omer-Cooper presented the mfecane as an internally generated
                  African revolution with little to do with European engagements
                  in the region – an independent African history for an
                  independent Africa.

                  In 1988, Julian Cobbing, writing in South Africa in advance of
                  the end of apartheid published a paper that attempted to upend
                  this way of seeing things. In ’The Mfecane as Alibi’, Cobbing
                  suggested that the notion of the mfecane was a construction of
                  settler history that framed the depopulation of South Africa’s
                  landscape in terms of black-on-black violence in order to
                  justify its occupation by incoming settlers. He pointed out
                  the ways in which it had been propagated ‘with unbelievable
                  rapidity’ through South African universities, schools, the
                  press, television and cinema after 1970 (Shaka Zulu, a major
                  television series produced by the South African Broadcasting
                  Corporation, first aired in 1986).⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  For Cobbing the ‘Afrocentrism’ of the mfecane myth conformed
                  to a pattern – in South Africa’s historical texts whites and
                  blacks were covered in separate chapters with their
                  interactions ‘generally ignored’. As Marxism, in the form of
                  dialectical materialism, came to dominate the theoretical
                  imaginations of many South African scholars during the 1970s
                  and 80s, the idea of ‘a purely internal revolution in ‘Bantu
                  Africa’’ came to seem increasingly naive – reinforcing the
                  apartheid state’s continued efforts to maintain distinct
                  administrative and conceptual frameworks to account for its
                  variously racialised citizens and subjects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Cobbing, the ‘motor of change… was not a self-generated
                  internal revolution with a short time-scale, but rather
                  European penetration, against which black societies threw up a
                  series of complex reactive states, that matured over a much
                  longer period of time’.⁠⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fn14" id="page-chapter-8-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  While many of Cobbing’s arguments focused on the details of
                  Zulu history, he deployed the Battle of Dithakong as a pivot
                  ‘on which to hinge a case study’ to test and challenge the
                  assumptions of mfecane theory.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cobbing argued that the ‘battle’ was an unprovoked ‘slave (and
                  cattle) raid’ that amounted to a ‘seven-hour massacre’.⁠⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fn16" id="page-chapter-8-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  He suggested that a shortage of labour in the Cape, following
                  the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, the exclusion from
                  the Colony of ‘black’ labourers in 1809, and the arrival of
                  British settlers in 1820 made battle captives, particularly
                  women and young boys, extremely valuable. According to
                  Cobbing:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The missionaries tried to depict themselves as succouring
                    the prisoners, and rescuing them from the evil chiefs and
                    starvation (with all those cattle?). There is no doubt,
                    however, that they were fully and consciously engrossed in
                    what they were doing, i.e. collecting slaves, and that the
                    cover of hypocrisy was intended to deflect the certain
                    censure from the government in London and from their seniors
                    in the London Missionary Society if it had leaked out that
                    they were selling people into slavery.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Re-reading Moffat’s account of the battle 35 years after
                  Cobbing published his paper and 25 years after I first
                  encountered it on my undergraduate reading list, I remain far
                  from convinced that the missionary was ‘consciously engrossed’
                  in capturing slaves, however much he may have struggled to
                  account for the events in which he played a part. Moffat was
                  certainly no saint – he regularly came into conflict with
                  others while forcefully pursuing his own agendas – but I
                  remain unconvinced that re-casting him as a villain helps us
                  to better understand the conflict or its wider implications
                  for African history.

                <p>
                  While I recognise that an entirely ‘Afrocentric’ framing of
                  the violence of the 1820s is potentially naive, both
                  historically and politically, I can’t help feeling that making
                  Europeans the sole ‘motor of change’ potentially reiterates a
                  narrative of African victimhood, denying a right of
                  self-determination in relation to the way Africans responded
                  to historical events.

                  In the context of recent battles around the focus and meaning
                  of ‘decolonisation’, Olúfémi Táíwo has pointed to the risk
                  that ‘making European colonisation the pole around which we
                  build our explanatory and narrative structures’ can mean we
                  fail to take African agency seriously.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  There were, after all, many Africans on both sides of the
                  battle that day, but only two Europeans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As I try to make sense of what happened at Dithakong on 26
                  June 1823, I return to the surviving textual accounts. Is it
                  possible that Robert Moffat found himself caught in the
                  crossfire of historical forces, and wrote in his journal to
                  figure out what had just happened and what it meant, just as I
                  am also trying to do two centuries later?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also return to the artefacts that were associated with ‘the
                  Mantatees’ at the Missionary Museum. Are these straightforward
                  trophies – looted from the field of battle as plunder, as
                  Cobbing’s framing of the battle might suggest? Or are they
                  something a little more ambivalent – a form of evidence that
                  anchors the textual accounts, becoming an alternative source
                  to be consulted even while a degree of uncertainty about
                  exactly who ‘the Mantatees’ were, and what they were doing at
                  Dithakong remains.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ambiguous and ambivalent, their digital images continue to
                  bear witness to an event around which competing narratives
                  continue to swirl. Perhaps in order to better assess the
                  reliability of Robert Moffat’s account, we need to know a
                  little about who he was and what he was doing at Dithakong in
                  the first place.

                  Born at Ormiston in Scotland in 1795, Moffat spent a period at
                  sea as a cabin boy before being apprenticed to a gardener at
                  the age of 14. Working at an estate in Cheshire, he became
                  involved with the Methodist movement, ultimately coming under
                  the influence of William Roby, minister of the Grosvenor
                  Street Congregational Church in Manchester. Roby arranged for
                  Moffat to be employed at a garden nursery in the city in 1816,
                  while he prepared for life as a missionary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In September 1816, Moffat travelled to the headquarters to of
                  the London Missionary Society, where according to a letter he
                  sent to his parents:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I spent some time in viewing the museum, which contains a
                    great number of curiosities from China, Africa, South Seas
                    and West Indies. It would be foolish for me to give you a
                    description. Suffice it to say that the sight is truly
                    awful, the appearance of the wild beasts is terrific, but I
                    am unable to describe the sensations of my mind when gazing
                    on the objects of pagan worship. Alas! How fallen my
                    fellow-creatures, bowing down to forms enough to frighten a
                    Roman soldier, enough to shake the hardest heart. Oh that I
                    had a thousand lives, and a thousand bodies: all of them
                    should be devoted to no other employment but to preach
                    Christ to these degraded, despised, yet beloved mortals. I
                    had not repented in becoming a missionary, and should I die
                    in the march, and never enter the field of battle, all will
                    be well.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  The recently opened museum clearly served to reinforce, if not
                  inspire, the commitment of aspiring missionaries such as
                  Moffat. At a service on 30 September involving John Campbell,
                  the ‘African traveller’, Moffat was dedicated for missionary
                  service alongside eight others, four for the Pacific
                  (including John Williams) and four others for South Africa. On
                  18 October, he sailed for South Africa on the
                  <em>Alacrity</em>, arriving at Cape Town in January
                  1817.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Permission to leave the Colony was refused by the Governor,
                  who was concerned that Griqua Town was becoming a place of
                  refuge for servants and slaves fleeing the Colony, so Moffat
                  lodged at a wine farm in Stellenbosch where he learned Dutch
                  until he received permission to go to Namaqualand the
                  following September.

                  Moffat arrived at the kraal of Jäger Afrikaner (literally
                  African Hunter) in late January 1818. A métis group of Khoe
                  descent, much like the Griqua, Afrikaner’s people had a
                  reputation as raiders and rustlers who traded cattle and ivory
                  with the Colony from the lands beyond. Jager was an outlaw
                  with a price on his head, having killed the white farmer by
                  whom the group had originally been employed (and with whom
                  they had engaged in raids).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Three German missionaries, recruited by Johannes Kicherer
                  during his visit to Europe, had begun work with Afrikaner’s
                  people in 1805. One of these, Johannes Seidenfaden, later
                  memorably described as ‘a wolf in sheep’s clothing’, seems to
                  have set about enriching himself from the proceeds of
                  Afrikaner’s ivory trade with the Cape, which provided the guns
                  and powder necessary for hunting and raiding.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1811, Jäger Afrikaner raided Seidenfaden’s mission station
                  at Pella, pillaging his house and taking a barrel of gunpowder
                  and a pair of guns, forcing the missionaries to retreat to
                  Cape Town. Following a visit by John Campbell in 1813, a
                  mission was re-established with Afrikaner in 1815, and in July
                  of that year he was baptised – an event that the historian
                  Nigel Penn has regarded as marking the beginning of a process
                  of closure for the Cape Colony’s northern frontier.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  In 1819, Robert Moffat arranged for Afrikaner to travel to
                  Cape Town, where he displayed his credentials as an exemplary
                  convert, in the process being awarded a wagon and the right to
                  enter the Colony by the governor.⁠⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fn23" id="page-chapter-8-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  While in Cape Town, Moffat met John Campbell and John Philip,
                  fellow Scots who had been sent by the Directors of the LMS to
                  adjudicate in a complicated set of grievances brought by a new
                  generation of missionaries, including Moffat, against the
                  older guard.

                  Campbell and Philip persuaded Moffat not to abandon his
                  missionary calling, but rather to accompany them as an
                  interpreter on a journey of inspection while he awaited the
                  arrival of his intended bride, whose parents had finally
                  agreed that she could make the journey from Manchester. Having
                  visited Bethelsdorp and other mission stations in the East of
                  the Colony, Moffat and Philip returned to Cape Town where they
                  met Mary on her arrival in December 1819 (her own inspiration
                  for missionary work came from hearing John Campbell speaking
                  in Manchester about his first journey to South Africa).⁠⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fn24" id="page-chapter-8-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Robert and Mary were married 19 days later, and it was decided
                  that Moffat should take over the mission at New Lattakoo
                  (Maruping). James Read, originally stationed at Bethelsdorp
                  with Vanderkemp in 1799, had taken himself there in
                  self-imposed exile after admitting to charges of sexual
                  impropriety.

                <p>
                  The Moffats travelled north with John Campbell early in 1820,
                  arriving at Griqua Town late in the evening on 13 March where
                  they found men making square buildings out of stone and women
                  ‘dressed in European fashion’ sewing cotton clothes. While
                  there, a wagon arrived with a party of thirty Batlhaping led
                  by a Griqua missionary, Jan Hendric, who taking ivory to trade
                  at a market arranged at the edge of the Cape Colony at
                  Beaufort West, 500 kilometres to the South.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 21 March, Campbell and the Moffats set off for Kuruman, and
                  on their journey encountered more people taking skins,
                  assegais, knives, shields to trade for beads at fair. Campbell
                  noticed that compared to his journey four years earlier, wild
                  game had become much scarcer due to the hunting activities of
                  Griqua and their guns.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Arriving at the mission, they found a row of missionary houses
                  behind a neat reed fence, with gardens at the back, as well as
                  a church capable of holding four hundred people. They had
                  brought a bell to be hung near the church to replace the horn
                  used previously to summon people to worship.⁠⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fn27" id="page-chapter-8-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  They were visited at the home of Robert Hamilton by the King
                  or Kgosi, Mothibi, as well as various other nobles, who were
                  presented with gifts ranging from snuff, beads and buttons to
                  tinder-boxes and kaleidoscopes. Moffat bargained for a two
                  gallon wooden container, made by the neighbouring Bakwena,
                  while some of the visitors amused themselves examining
                  portraits from the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> displayed on
                  the walls, including one of Campbell himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Campbell expressed his satisfaction that under the influence
                  of James Read, Mothibi had ceased the system of commandoes to
                  raid cattle from neighbouring groups, but Mothibi pointed out
                  that without this source of income, he needed guns and
                  gunpowder to hunt wild animals.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  When Campbell and Read departed on a journey to the North,
                  visiting Dithakong as well as the substantial city of
                  Kaditshwene – but also meeting Campbell’s old friend Cupido
                  Kakkerlak then serving as a missionary to the Coranna – the
                  Moffats stayed at Maruping to establish relationships at what
                  would become their new station.

                <p>
                  In the meantime Jäger Afrikaner arrived with a wagon of
                  Moffat’s belongings, including many books. When Campbell
                  returned to the Colony with Read, much to the displeasure of
                  the residents of Maruping, the Moffats went for a time to
                  Griqua Town, before joining Hamilton permanently at the
                  mission in May 1821, still in their mid-twenties.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  It was at in the course of attempting a journey of his own to
                  the Tswana towns of the North-East that Moffat met reports
                  that invading Mantatees close at hand had in fact overrun many
                  of these towns, including Kaditshwene. Fearing for the safety
                  of his young family, he returned to Maruping to decide on a
                  course of action. While the Batlhaping prepared for war,
                  Moffat rode to Griqua Town to request assistance.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  On 13 June 1823, a <em>pitsho</em> or parliament of armed men,
                  assembled. One old man exhorted the crowd by telling them it
                  was the pitsho of the missionary, and as such they should
                  speak and act not like Batswana but like Makgoas (white
                  people). The Makgoas, meanwhile, buried their possessions so
                  that they could make a quick escape.⁠⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fn31" id="page-chapter-8-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                  Success in repelling the invading ‘Mantatees’ seems to have
                  marked a significant material change for both the Moffat
                  household, by then featuring two very young children, and the
                  mission of which they formed a part. In a letter to Mary’s
                  parents dated 23 July 1823, from Griqua Town less than a month
                  after the battle, Robert Moffat declared that four of the
                  ‘prisoners’ were ‘inmates’ of his family:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Mason or Mahum (Mmahuma), a woman about 25 yeas of age;
                    Moshanee, also a woman, rather older; Fahaange, a boy, about
                    eight years old; and a girl about four (Niywe). Mary has
                    made Mahum, cook, and Moshanee nurse and washerwoman; and
                    the boy, who seems clever, I shall find useful. Considering
                    their former savage state, they do exceedingly well.
                    Moshanee makes a good nurse, and helps to wash very well.
                    This is a great comfort to Mary, as washing is her greatest
                    hardship in this climate. They seem very happy in their new
                    situation, and pleased with their clothes…⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Returning to Maruping in August, Moffat found his garden
                  destroyed but much of his former home in a better state than
                  expected. He subsequently rescued another starving refugee he
                  found being beaten with stones by some boys, taking her to his
                  kitchen where he gave her food and clothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The provision of food and clothes allowed Moffat to present
                  the ‘Mantatees’ as the recipients of charity, but their
                  deployment as supplementary household labour – feeding and
                  washing the Moffat family – suggests that the relationship was
                  rather more complicated. Indeed, their exact status seems to
                  have been fairly ambiguous: the fact that Moffat refers to
                  them as ‘prisoners’ and ‘inmates’ seems significant.

                  Moffat used his new-found influence to argue for the mission’s
                  relocation to a reedy valley eight miles closer to the spring
                  at Kuruman known as Seodin – a seemingly ideal location for
                  someone trained as a gardener. Kgosi Mothibi agreed to grant
                  two miles of the valley adjacent to the island to the
                  missionaries, noting that their presence might provide
                  protection for his cattle from raiding nearby ‘bushmen’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These arrangements having been made in principle, Moffat set
                  off for Cape Town in October 1823 to seek approval from LMS
                  superintendent John Philip, with a promise to return with the
                  necessary goods for a remuneration – variously described as 40
                  lbs of beads or a small sum of around £5.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moffat took with him Kgosi Mothibi’s son and heir, Phetlu, as
                  well as an advisor, Thaišo, who became celebrities at the
                  Cape. They visited the city’s famous castle, its schools as
                  well as the museum, a year before its official establishment.
                  George Thompson, who had met them during preparations for the
                  battle, commissioned their portraits by a recently arrived
                  English artist, Henry Clifford de Meillon. Phetlu and Thaišo
                  seem to have been struck by the ships, but were especially
                  pleased when presented with two guns and some powder by the
                  Governor, who they told ‘had made their hearts white’.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was presumably from Cape Town that Moffat forwarded a
                  series of items to the Missionary Museum, which had so
                  impressed him just over seven years earlier. These were listed
                  in the Catalogue of the Missionary Museum, printed in 1826
                  with a description on page 38:
                </p>
                <p>NECK RINGS, used by the Chiefs’ wives of the Mantantese.</p>
                <p>
                  The nation is very remote in the interior of South Africa,
                  about 40,000 of whom left their country on a plundering
                  expedition, pillaging all the counties through which they
                  passed, till they reached the city of Lattakoo, in the
                  neighbourhood of which they were repulsed. On this occasion,
                  these rings, with various other articles, were taken. The four
                  rings were worn by one female.
                </p>
                <p>
                  COPPER ORNAMENTS, worn by the same nation.⁠⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-8-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-8-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, the following items featured as part of a list of
                  material from a shelf on page 42:
                </p>
                <ol start="29">
                  <li>
                    <p>A COPPER RING, from the Mantantese.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>A Mantantese NEEDLE.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>A Mantantese KNIFE.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>A Mantantese APRON.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  A later version of the catalogue, printed around 1860 listed
                  the same apron as:
                </p>
                <p>
                  A Manatee female apron of iron beads. – Presented by Rev. R.
                  Moffat
                </p>
                <p>
                  While it seems likely that this was picked up on the field of
                  battle, it remains possible that it was given to Moffat by one
                  of the women who was taken into his household when they were
                  provided with European clothes. This ambiguity parallels the
                  ambiguous legal status of the women. Were they refugees or
                  captives, enslaved or free?
                </p>
                <p>
                  As well as these ‘Mantatee’ artefacts, Moffat seems to have
                  taken five ‘Mantatee’ women and a boy with him to Cape Town.
                  While there are no surviving individual portraits like those
                  of Phetlu and Thaišo, George Thompson’s 1827 account of his
                  Travels and Adventures in Southern Africa does include a
                  vignette of ‘Mantatee Portraits’ at the beginning of Chapter
                  XVI. A footnote on page 320 states that they were rescued by
                  Messrs. Melvill, Hamilton and Moffat:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The female, by name Mahum, has a mild and pleasing
                    countenance, as, indeed, most of the Mantatee females have,
                    indicating nothing of cannibal ferocity. She is now in Cape
                    Town, and has proved herself a very good and faithful
                    servant.<br>
                    The other figure is that of a boy about nine years of age,
                    named Tahana. He was saved by Mr. Moffat, and having lost
                    all his own relatives, has become affectionately
                    domesticated in the family of his benefactor.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  A report in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> for November
                  1824 suggests that their status remained uncertain within the
                  Colony, since when travelling through Stellenbosch, the
                  Mantatee women, walking at a small distance from the wagon,
                  were arrested by two constables and taken to prison. When
                  missionaries appealed to the Landdrost the following morning,
                  the women were released. However, it does not seem to have
                  been the constables alone who were unclear about the legal
                  status of these women within the Colony.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When asked about the captives from the battle at an enquiry on
                  20 April 1824, Moffat declared that rather than being
                  captives:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    the women and children, who were left on the field,
                    abandoned and famished, were offered protection, which many
                    of them accepted, to save their lives; and it was explained
                    to them by Mr. Melville and myself, that they had the option
                    of following in search of their tribe, or of remaining; a
                    few went away, but the greater part remained on the field,
                    and a few came with us; these were taken into the houses of
                    those Griquas who were able to provide for them. It will
                    probably now have been settled on what footing they are to
                    remain with them.
                  </p>

                <blockquote>

                    Mr. Melville sent some of them to Graaf Rennet… The Mantatee
                    women, I have understood, were distributed in the Colony
                    amongst the Boors, but upon what footing I do not know. The
                    Griquas entrusted to bring them into the Colony received 100
                    rix dollars from the landdrost…

                    Baird at Beaufort, from my knowledge of the care he would
                    take of them, and two are in the care of Dr. Philip. One I
                    brought down, at the request of Mr. Melville, for his
                    sister; but as she had died I made this woman over to Mr
                    Melville’s father-in-law, who I remember to have exposed his
                    intention of having her booked in; but I admonished him that
                    the woman was free, not understanding what he meant by
                    booking in.

                  Robert Moffat may not have thought he was engaged in a slave
                  raid, but that clearly doesn’t mean that everyone else,
                  including the ‘Mantatee women’ themselves, regarded things
                  that way. He declared in 1824 that the Botswana ‘have a
                  servile class, but no slaves’, but quite how the captives of
                  battle expected to be treated remains unclear from a distance
                  of two centuries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1823, slavery continued to exist within the Cape Colony
                  although the 1807 abolition of the slave trade had cut off the
                  supply of enslaved people to this largely plantation-based
                  economy. How different in practice, if perhaps not in law, was
                  the status of the young orphaned Tahana when ‘affectionately
                  domesticated in the family of his benefactor’, to that of
                  someone who had been formally enslaved?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Does it make a difference today whether the metal apron was
                  taken from the body of someone who was alive or dead, or
                  indeed whether it was taken by Moffat himself or rather by an
                  African combatant?

                  Many of those attending the thirtieth anniversary meeting of
                  the London Missionary Society were deeply concerned about
                  news, recently received, concerning the death of their
                  missionary John Smith, following the Demerara rebellion
                  (Chapter 5). The Rev. Dr. David Bogue, however, directed the
                  meeting’s attention to the achievements of two of his former
                  students, Dr Robert Morrison and Dr William Milne, who had
                  recently produced a translation of the Bible into Chinese:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>By their labours the Scriptures are rendered intelligible
                    to some hundreds of millions of the human race. Strange!
                    (Said Dr. B.) strange! That 1800 years should have been
                    suffered to elapse before the Bible should be translated
                    into the language of the most numerous class of people of
                    the world</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Three decades earlier, Bogue’s appeal
                  <em>To the evangelical dissenters who practice infant
                    baptism</em>
                  had led to the establishment of the Missionary Society.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  He had personally volunteered for missionary service in India
                  in 1796, along with his former student Robert Haldane, but
                  they had been blocked by the East India Company. Having
                  studied Divinity at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland,
                  Bogue thought missionaries needed a rigorous education,
                  including a working knowledge of Greek, Latin and Hebrew, to
                  allow them to translate the Bible, which he felt was more
                  important than preaching, at least initially.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the early years of the Missionary Society, Bogue’s vision
                  came up against that of Thomas Haweis, an Oxford-educated
                  Anglican from Cornwall, who thought it sufficient to despatch
                  ‘godly mechanics’ as missionaries. Haweis’ approach eventually
                  bore fruit after two decades with the conversion of Pomare at
                  Tahiti by the bricklayer Henry Nott (Chapter 4). During the
                  Society’s first decade, however, many ‘godly mechanics’
                  abandoned their stations in Tahiti and South Africa prompting
                  the Directors to reconsider their approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1800 Bogue was made responsible for training prospective
                  missionaries at his Gosport Academy in Hampshire, where he had
                  trained Independent Ministers since 1789. Robert Morrison was
                  one of the early missionary students, arriving in 1804.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two decades later, Morrison sat listening to Bogue’s speech,
                  having recently returned from China. At the prompting of
                  others, he stood to address the meeting, holding a letter of
                  instructions he had been given by the Society’s treasurer,
                  Joseph Hardcastle, in early 1807:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>At that period I was considered a Lay-Missionary, – a sort
                    of mathematician sent to gain, if practicable, a residence
                    in yonder region. The acquisition of the language was
                    thought scarcely possible; though a faint hope was
                    entertained that it might be acquired, and that a Dictionary
                    might be composed, and the Holy Scripture might be
                    translated in Chinese; and now, after 17 years residence in
                    that country, I stand here before God and before you this
                    day, and would our esteemed friend were yet on earth to
                    witness our laying before the Society the scarcely
                    anticipated result of this undertaking</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Morrison then presented a copy of the Bible along with ‘a copy
                  of the Chinese and English Dictionary’ to the assembled London
                  Missionary Society.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Morrison was clear that ultimate credit for his achievements
                  rested with God. Nevertheless, the success of his mission to
                  China, and particularly his production of the Dictionary,
                  suggest credit was also owed to Britain’s premier joint-stock
                  company, the East India Company, with which he formed a
                  strategic alliance.

                  Morrison arrived back in London in March 1824, stopping
                  briefly at Cape Town on his way from China, where he met
                  Robert Moffat (another of Bogue’s former students), presumably
                  with his ‘Mantatee’ captives (Chapter 8). Morrison was himself
                  accompanied on the journey by a Chinese servant, ‘Poon a Sam’,
                  referred to by Bogue in his speech as ‘a Christian Chinese
                  whom we are delighted to see amongst us this day’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Intriguingly, the
                  <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum,</em> printed two years
                  later in 1826, lists a number of items presented by ‘A Sam’
                  including a pair of shoes, Chinese combs and a brush, two
                  curiously carved coconut cups, as well as the Chinese cup used
                  by Morrison.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This chapter’s title also comes from the four-page ‘CHINA’
                  section, two-thirds of the way through the <em>Catalogue</em>.
                  Although a number of Chinese ‘idols’ are listed at the
                  beginning of the section, it also includes a type of artefact
                  unlike most others in the <em>Catalogue</em> – printed books.
                  The first to be listed, in a section describing the contents
                  of ‘the fourth shelf’, is Morrison’s ‘<em>Chinese and English dictionary</em>’. This is followed by two of his other books:
                  <em>‘Grammar of the Chinese Language’</em> (1815) and a ‘<em>A View of China for Philological Purposes</em>’ (1817). Only then is his Bible translation listed as:
                </p>
                <p>
                  A
                  <em>COPY of the SACRED SCRIPTURES of the Old and New Testament,
                    translated into the Chinese language by the indefatigable
                    labours of Dr. Robert Morrison, assisted in part of the
                    work, by the late Dr. Milne, of Malacca.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>By this great achievement, many millions of the human race
                    may be enlightened in the knowledge of God our Saviour.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This, however, is followed by listings for
                  <em>Four Books on Drawing, published by the Chinese</em> and
                  <em>A Work of Agriculture, &amp;c.</em> ‘concerning the
                  husbandry and the cultivation of Silk’ encouraged by Emperor
                  Kang-Hi (Kangxi). Unlike South Africa and Tahiti, where there
                  was no established form of writing, China had its own history
                  of textual production. Indeed, Bogue seems to have felt that
                  literacy was an important marker of ‘civilisation’,
                  necessitating an approach to missionary work that was rooted
                  in textual production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Chinese books in the Missionary Museum may have formed a
                  small part of the library of nearly 10,000 Chinese books which
                  Morrison brought with him from China. It is curious,
                  particularly perhaps for a Protestant missionary society, that
                  the ‘Sacred Scriptures’ appear to be sandwiched between works
                  on the Chinese language and others on drawing and agriculture,
                  given the emphasis given to ‘this great achievement’ with its
                  potential for conveying ‘the knowledge of God our Saviour’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps this ordering reflects the arrangement of the volumes
                  on the shelf, with the Bible displayed at its centre. It may
                  also be progressive, suggesting that it was Morrison’s
                  dictionary and grammar that ultimately enabled his translation
                  of the <em>Sacred Scriptures</em>. In any case, it is
                  significant that the dictionary and the Bible translation were
                  presented to the Society together in May 1824, and continued
                  to be displayed alongside each other at the museum, since
                  these two major works competed for Morrison’s time and
                  attention over nearly two decades.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the Bible translation was funded by the London
                  Missionary Society, with contributions from the British and
                  Foreign Bible Society (established by a similarly
                  non-denominational group of evangelicals in 1804), the
                  three-volume 4,826 page dictionary, printed in six parts
                  between 1815 and 1823, was funded exclusively by the East
                  India Company, to the tune of over £10,000.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Given that the East India Company was officially opposed to
                  the operation of Christian missionaries, as potentially
                  disruptive to trade, how was Morrison able to serve these two
                  masters?

                <p>
                  Born in 1782 at Morpeth in Northumberland, in the far north of
                  England, Morrison was the youngest of eight children. His
                  father had been a Scottish farm labourer who moved to
                  Newcastle-upon-Tyne to work as a shoe-tree maker. Following an
                  apprenticeship with his father, Morrison applied to train as a
                  minister, moving to London to study at the Hoxton Academy at
                  the age of 20. In early 1804 he applied to become a missionary
                  and was sent to Bogue’s Gosport Academy to complete his
                  training. Morrison hoped he might go with Mungo Park to
                  Timbuktu in Africa, and prayed that God send him ‘to some
                  situation where he will make me abundantly useful to the souls
                  of men’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  In 1805, the London Missionary Society directors outlined a
                  plan to send missionaries to Prince of Wales Island (Penang –
                  under East India Company control since 1786), where it was
                  hoped they would learn Chinese with the aim of translating the
                  Bible.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Morrison began to learn Chinese with Yong Samtak (Rong Sande)
                  from Canton (Guangzhou), who had come to London on an East
                  India Company ship to learn English. Together they transcribed
                  <em>Evangelia Quatuor Sinica</em>, a manuscript copy of a
                  harmony of the gospels in Chinese, made by Jesuits in the
                  eighteenth century, which had recently been found at the
                  British Museum.

                  Ordained in early 1807, Morrison left London at the end of
                  January with two missionaries bound for India. Since the East
                  India Company, which held a trading monopoly in China, refused
                  to carry missionaries in their ships, they sailed first to New
                  York. On arrival, Morrison went to Philadelphia to meet
                  American missionary supporters in the hope they could provide
                  him with a letter of introduction to the American Consul at
                  Canton, the only place Europeans were permitted to trade in
                  China after 1757.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sailing in mid-May, Morrison arrived at the Thirteen Factories
                  in September 1807, having briefly met English residents at
                  Macau, approximately 60 kilometres to the South near the mouth
                  of the Pearl River. They told him the Chinese were forbidden
                  from teaching outsiders on pain of death, and that working in
                  Macau would be difficult on account of Catholic resentments in
                  this Portuguese-controlled entrepôt. Morrison’s letter of
                  instruction from Hardcastle made it clear that, many months
                  travel from London, he was at ‘liberty to act on every
                  occasion according to the dictates of your own prudence and
                  discretion’, suggesting he find employment as a mathematician
                  or teacher of English.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Morrison found lodgings in the old French Factory, under the
                  supervision of American traders. The First American ships had
                  arrived in 1784, shortly after the treaty of Paris granted
                  independence to the United States, and by the time Morrison
                  arrived the major trade good they brought was sandalwood from
                  Hawai’i and other Pacific islands (Chapter 7). Morrison,
                  pretending to be American, worked secretly to learn Chinese,
                  with assistance from Yin Kwan-ming (Abel Yin), a Chinese
                  Catholic from Peking (Beijing). He was also taught Cantonese
                  by Le Sëensang (Li Xiansheng), a Catholic whose father had
                  undergone priestly training with Jesuits in Portugal for 12
                  years.

                  In November 1807, before the Missionary Museum was established
                  in London, Morrison sent a number of curiosities back to
                  Joseph Hardcastle. These included a figure of Kwan-yin (one of
                  these is the first item listed in the China section of the
                  1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum), three weapons used
                  by Malays (three KRIS from Java are listed in the 1826
                  catalogue), a pair of wooden sandals, as well as paintings
                  ‘illustrative of the idolatry of this benighted people’. He
                  also sent a book – a history of China which he asked be sent
                  to the Royal Society, since he knew no copy was then available
                  in London.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Morrison asked Hardcastle to send him copies of the
                  <em>Missionary Magazine</em>, a little more money (he found
                  living as a European in Canton exorbitant), as well as some
                  striped pocket handkerchiefs – ‘a very acceptable present to
                  the Chinese’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  By December 1807, Morrison had acquired between four and five
                  hundred volumes in Chinese on language, religion, philosophy,
                  medicine, laws and history. Partly for financial reasons,
                  Morrison initially adopted Chinese styles of dress and food,
                  but came to see this ultimately made him more conspicuous,
                  living as he was among the European and American traders
                  within the restricted factory zone.

                  In June 1808, Morrison travelled to the English factory at
                  Macao, 100 miles to the South, remaining for three months to
                  improve his health. He was, at that time, assisted to find a
                  house by the chief of the English factory and representative
                  of the East India Company, John Roberts, to enable his work on
                  a Chinese Dictionary.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  In October, the English were expelled from Canton after East
                  India Company troops occupied Macao, ostensibly to protect it
                  from the French, so Morrison returned to Macao but seems to
                  have felt he would soon need to move to Penang, as originally
                  proposed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While at Macao, however, Morrison formed a close friendship
                  with the evangelically minded Morton family from Ireland,
                  recently arrived traders, and on 20 February 1809 he married
                  Mary Morton, their eldest daughter. On the same day he was
                  offered a post as Chinese Translator and Secretary for the
                  East India Company’s Factory at Canton, with a salary of £500
                  a year. This provided him with an official position, allowing
                  him to continue studying the language, working on the Chinese
                  Dictionary, while continuing his translation of the bible
                  privately. When informed of these developments, the Missionary
                  Society’s representatives divined the gracious hand of
                  God.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  By September 1810, Morrison had revised a translation of the
                  Acts of the Apostles based on the manuscript in London, and
                  had 1000 copies printed secretly. By the end of the same year
                  he revised a translation of Luke’s Gospel, which he also
                  printed locally. Writing from London in March 1812, Hardcastle
                  and Burder thanked Morrison for the three copies of his
                  translation of Acts which he had sent them, noting:

                    sake of gratifying some of our friends in the country, and
                    the Directors hope that when you shall have printed another
                    portion of the Sacred Word they shall receive at least two
                    dozen copies. One of the three with which you favoured us
                    was presented by us to the British and Foreign Bible
                    Society, who kindly voted £500 towards the important object
                    of printing the Sacred Scriptures in the Chinese language;
                    and another copy was ordered to be unstitched for
                    distribution among the friends of the Society in England,
                    Scotland, Wales and Ireland, who have expressed themselves
                    gratified, in no small degree, to behold the first-fruits of
                    the labours of their missionary in China, on whose behalf
                    the prayers of thousands have been, doubtless, thereby
                    excited.

                    presented an ocular demonstration of the existence of the

                    We especially rejoice in hearing that the improvement in the
                    art of printing, by means of stereotype, is not confined to
                    Europe, but that from your wood-cut characters you are
                    assured that, by occasionally retouching them when
                    necessary, a hundred thousand copies may be procured.

                  While the adoption of stereotype printing – using a single
                  solid printing block for each page of text – was a new
                  technology in Europe that was in the process of replacing
                  plates composed from individual letters of moveable type, the
                  technique used by Morrison’s Chinese printers was far from
                  new.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Indeed, woodblock printing, with each page of text composed on
                  a carved wooden block, dated back over a thousand years in

                  When Morrison completed printing Luke’s Gospel he only sent
                  one copy to London, perhaps because he felt that as a book it
                  would be more valuable to those who could actually read it.
                  Nevertheless, the Society’s representatives in London were
                  mindful of the propaganda value of ‘ocular proof’ of
                  Morrison’s work of translation, even if it meant unbinding
                  books so that individual pages could be circulated to
                  supporters.

                  The same letter, written in March 1812, updated Morrison with
                  news of fellow missionaries in Africa and the Pacific,
                  informing him that he would soon be joined by a missionary
                  colleague, William Milne, a Scot, recommended by Dr Bogue.

                  In 1812, the Chinese Emperor expelled four Catholic
                  missionaries from Peking (Beijing) and issued an edict which
                  made printing books in Chinese on the Christian religion a
                  capital crime. Morrison began to think that missionary work in
                  China needed an institution to train Chinese missionaries in
                  the Malayan archipelago, where a mission press could print
                  translations and tracts beyond the influence of the Emperor.

                  In September 1812, the Rev. William Milne and his wife left
                  Britain, arriving in Macao in early July the following year.
                  As a result of lobbying by the Catholic bishop, the council at
                  Macao declared that he could not stay, so he went to Canton
                  alone, European women not being allowed at the Thirteen
                  Factories. Finding Canton challenging without an association
                  with the East India Company, Milne travelled to Java, Malacca
                  and Penang, all then under British control, to find a suitable
                  location to establish a mission, returning to Canton in
                  September 1813.

                  Meanwhile, the East India Company despatched a printer,
                  <a href="#page-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-peter-perring-thoms" target="_blank">Peter Perring Thoms</a>, who arrived in China in September 1814 with a press and the
                  necessary equipment to begin printing Morrison’s Chinese
                  dictionary. Thoms was paid £300 a year by the Company, working
                  with local assistants who cut Chinese fonts in tin alloy. 1814
                  saw the completion of Morrison’s translation of the New
                  Testament, based on the manuscript at the British Museum, but
                  also the baptism of his first convert, Tsae Tia A-Ko (<a href="#page-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-cai-gao" target="_blank">Cai Gao</a>), one of the type-cutters.

                  In 1815 Morrison’s <em>Chinese Grammar</em> was printed by the
                  Mission Press at Serampore in India, funded by the East India
                  Company, while Thoms began printing the first part of the
                  first volume of his dictionary. The ongoing ill-health of
                  Mary, Morrison’s wife meant that she travelled to London early
                  that year, together with their two young children. In April,
                  Morrison was once again left alone, when the Milnes left to
                  establish what was called the Ultra Ganges Mission. Malacca
                  was chosen as the best location mostly because of its
                  centrality to areas of Chinese settlement in the Malay
                  archipelago, but also due to its relatively healthy climate
                  and maritime connections to both India and Canton.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Ongoing persecution of Christians in China meant that those
                  employed cutting Chinese types for Morrison’s dictionary were
                  seized by the authorities, and in alarm, the book-seller who
                  held the wooden printing blocks for a small edition of his New
                  Testament destroyed them. The Directors of the Missionary
                  Society asked Morrison whether it was cheaper to print his
                  bible translation using the Chinese method with wooden blocks,
                  or with moveable metal types. Morrison seems to have discussed
                  the matter with the Company’s printer, Thoms, ‘who is daily in
                  use of single metal types’ for the Dictionary. According to
                  Morrison, in a reply written in November 1815, if metal
                  stereotype is cheaper than the letter press in Europe, wooden
                  blocks in China are ‘much cheaper than English stereotype’
                  since a Chinese ‘type-cutter requires only a fair copy’ while
                  English stereotypes had to be cast from pages that were first
                  composed with moveable type:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>The single letters in Chinese being so numerous, and
                    arranged under no fewer than 214 radicals, though each
                    character be a word, it requires more time to find any given
                    word than is necessary to compose it from the Roman letter.
                    A word from a Greek case, with all its accents, would be
                    composed sooner than a Chinese character, from a collection
                    of thirty or forty thousand characters, arranged in the best
                    possible manner</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Morrison estimated that cutting the Chinese characters for the
                  New Testament would cost 800 dollars, when his wood blocks
                  only cost 500 dollars. He also thought that Chinese printers
                  were able to print many more copies a day, and be paid less
                  than European printers. Using the local technique meant that
                  copies of the bible could be printed from the wooden blocks as
                  and when they were needed, with no involvement from Morrison:
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am myself fully convinced that all than can be said in
                  favour of metal stereotype for printing standard books,
                  applies with fully as much, if not with greater force and
                  truth, to the Chinese wooden stereotype.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to Milne, writing from Malacca in December 1815:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    As to the beauty of the <em>impression</em>, which is
                    certainly the very least consideration, the advantage is in
                    favour of the blocks. All Chinese printing with
                    <em>moveable types,</em> even with regularly
                    <em>cast</em> types, that I have yet seen, looks like the
                    work of <em>foreigners</em>, and possesses not that freedom
                    which the Chinese method has. To the Chinese, books printed
                    with moveable types, have a certain awkward stiffness in
                    their appearance.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  In October 1815 Morrison received discouraging news – as a
                  result of the Missionary Society publicity surrounding his
                  ongoing translation work, something undertaken outside of his
                  employment, the East India Company’s Court of Directors in
                  London had sent orders that he be dismissed. This was
                  essentially ignored by the Company representatives in China,
                  given how essential Morrison’s translation skills had become
                  to their commercial and diplomatic negotiations in Canton.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Indeed, during the second half of 1816, Morrison accompanied a
                  British diplomatic mission to the Qing court in Peking
                  (Beijing), led by Lord Amherst. Ultimately, Amherst refused to
                  kowtow before the emperor and was refused entry to the
                  imperial city. The journey, however, gave Morrison many
                  opportunities to observe life in Imperial China, contributing
                  to his
                  <em>View of China for Philological Purposes,</em> subsequently
                  printed in Macao by Thoms.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Meanwhile at Malacca, in November 1816, Milne baptised
                  <a href="#page-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-liang-fa" target="_blank">Liang Fa</a>, a Chinese printer who went there with him the previous
                  year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By early 1817, the mission press at Malacca had printed 9000
                  copies of the New Testament. In June of that year, the Ultra
                  Ganges Mission was reinforced by the arrival a Walter Henry
                  Medhurst, an experienced young printer from London. While work
                  on Bible translation was strengthened by the establishment of
                  a printing workshop at Milne’s mission at Malacca, work on the
                  dictionary in Canton was slowed when its types were seized by
                  Chinese authorities when one of the workmen took a sheet of
                  the Dictionary to the Chinese District Magistrate. When the
                  Viceroy of Canton ordered that foreigners should not assist
                  foreigners in printing the Chinese language, Thoms has to work
                  with Portuguese workmen at Macao to cut Chinese characters for
                  the Dictionary.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Reflecting on what had been achieved after a decade in China,
                  Morrison and Milne recognised that without the support of the
                  East India Company, progress on the Dictionary would likely
                  have been much slower. While the Company’s support came ‘no
                  doubt chiefly, if not solely, for commercial and literary
                  purposes’ they suggested that this is no way lessened ‘the
                  usefulness of the work, to those who wish to promote the
                  knowledge of the Gospel in China’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  While Morrison’s work for the East India Company competed for
                  his time with his work on translation, his association with
                  the company provided significant financial resources, as well
                  as connections with established Sinologists such as Sir George
                  Staunton, enabling his work to gain international recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1817 Morrison was awarded the Degree of Doctor of Divinity
                  by the University of Glasgow, and in 1818 he was able to
                  contribute £1000 towards the establishment of the
                  Anglo-Chinese College at Malacca, to which he promised a
                  further £100 a year for five years. The object of the college
                  was ‘the cultivation of Chinese and European Literature, in
                  order to the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ’, and with
                  Milne appointed as its first principal, it was clearly a
                  missionary establishment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Nevertheless, the College statutes did not exclude ‘any branch
                  of human knowledge; nor any one of the circle of the sciences’
                  and the College Library was:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>to consist of European and Foreign Books, MSS., Maps.
                    Charts, Drawings and Philosophical Apparatus; to which was
                    to be attached a Museum of natural and artificial
                    curiosities</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is noteworthy that this museum at Malacca followed the
                  establishment of the Missionary Museum in London by only four
                  years. While recent conflicts between creationism and
                  Darwinism can seem emblematic of an anti-scientific attitude
                  among contemporary evangelical Christians, this was not the
                  case in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Science,
                  and perhaps particularly Natural History, were regarded as an
                  important part of the new knowledge that missionary
                  educational establishments intended to communicate. Indeed,
                  this may have been particularly the case in China, where an
                  examination of Catholic missionary history suggested that it
                  had been European scientific knowledge which made Matteo Ricci
                  of greatest interest to the Chinese Emperor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Milne ultimately found that he had to pay the
                  families of his Chinese students the equivalent to the wages
                  they could earn by manual labour, the Anglo-Chinese College
                  gradually built a reputation for academic excellence (it
                  relocated to Hong Kong in 1843, where today Ying Wa College
                  claims descent from the original College at Malacca).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 25 November 1819, Morrison wrote to the Missionary Society
                  Directors in London somewhat triumphantly, telling them that
                  at last the whole Bible had been translated into Chinese —
                  Milne had worked on the Book of Job as well as the Historical
                  Books of the Old Testament. Morrison acknowledged that the
                  result was based on the Jesuit manuscript at the British
                  Museum, and had imperfections, but understood his efforts in
                  relation to a history of Bible translations into English:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>If Morrison and Milne’s Bible shall, in China, at some
                    subsequent period, hold such a place in reference to a
                    better translation, as Wickliff’s or Tyndale’s now hold in
                    reference to our present English version, many will for ever
                    bless God for the attempt; and neither the Missionary
                    Society, nor the Bible Society, will ever regret the funds
                    they have, or shall yet expend in aid of the object</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>It is not yet 500 years since Wickliff’s bones were dug up
                    and burnt, chiefly because he translated the Scriptures; and
                    it is not yet 300 years since Tyndall was strangled by the
                    hands of the common hangman, and then burnt for the same
                    cause…</em>.

                  <em>King James’s translators were fifty-four in number, and
                    rendered into their mother tongue in their native country,

                  He was, of course, only thinking of the European translators
                  and it is important to recognise the labours of the many
                  Chinese who worked alongside both Morrison and Milne to
                  undertake this work. It is significant that they appear in a
                  number of images showing Morrison at work, suggesting a close
                  partnership.

                  Morrison hoped that ‘Moses, David, and the prophets; Jesus
                  Christ and his apostles, using their own words’ would dispel
                  ‘the gloomy darkness of pagan scepticism’ and that the ‘gilded
                  idols of Budh, and the numberless images which fill the land,
                  will one day assuredly fall to the ground, before the force of
                  God’s word, as the idol Dagon fell before the ark’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  In August 1820, Morrison’s wife returned to China after nearly
                  six years away, together with their children, but she sadly
                  died less than a year later. In early 1822, Morrison arranged
                  for his son and daughter to be sent back to Britain, but
                  another tragedy followed when Milne died in the midst of
                  revising the last two books of the Bible for printing.

                  Morrison’s Dictionary was also nearing completion, with Part
                  III printed in 1822. However, a major fire at Canton in
                  November 1822 caused significant damage, including the
                  destruction of ‘a hundred pounds worth of paper’ Morrison had
                  intended to send to Malacca to print the Bible.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Reflecting on the anniversary of 15 years in China, Morrison
                  was frustrated that neither his dictionary nor Bible
                  translation had yet been printed in full, but nevertheless
                  took significant pride in the establishment of the
                  Anglo-Chinese College, suggesting it had provoked the
                  establishment of both the Serampore College and the Episcopal
                  Mission College (Bishop’s College) in Calcutta (Kolkata).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  In January 1823 Morrison travelled to Malacca where he visited
                  the Anglo-Chinese College for the first time. The following
                  month he went to the recently established East India Company
                  settlement at Singapore, where he discussed relocating the
                  college with Sir Stamford Raffles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Back in London, Morrison’s long-term correspondent and
                  supporter, Sir George Staunton, was in the process of setting
                  up an Oriental Library and Museum, as part of the
                  establishment of an Asiatic Society in London.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  By November 1823, both the Bible and the Dictionary had been
                  printed and it was proposed that the East India Company press
                  be sent to the Anglo-Chinese College. By that time, the
                  college had a library of 3380 volumes (2850 in Chinese), as
                  well as scientific equipment that included an ‘electrical
                  machine and battery’, perhaps brought to China by Morrison in
                  1807.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  The museum contained Chinese drawings, maps and charts, as
                  well as ‘Specimens of Chinese Court Beads, Musical
                  Instruments, Sounding Vases used in Temples, Bronze Figures,
                  Specimens of Weights and Measures, Specimens of Materia Medica
                  of China’ as well as, somewhat intriguingly ’Specimens of the
                  rocks in Palestine, Birds of Paradise, Cups of Bacchus, and
                  Petrefactions’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  With his Dictionary and Bible translation printed, Morrison
                  finally seems to have felt able to return home. He sailed in
                  an East Indiaman, the <em>Waterloo,</em> in early December
                  1823, along with around 10,000 printed volumes in Chinese.
                  Arriving in March the following year, he began a lengthy
                  negotiation to avoid paying import duties on his library,
                  which seems to have been taken up on his behalf by Staunton
                  who also arranged for Morrison to present his Bible
                  translation to King George IV on 15 April 1824.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The East India Company agreed to pay Morrison half his salary
                  while in Britain, and he arranged to visit family in Newcastle
                  before returning to London for the annual meetings of the
                  London Missionary Society, the Bible Society and the Religious
                  Tract Society in May, together with his son,

                  as meeting European sinologists.

                  When Morrison’s ‘Chinese Library and curiosities’ finally
                  cleared customs in June 1824, they were transferred to the
                  London Missionary Society headquarters, where a catalogue was
                  prepared by his servant, A Sam.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Morrison attempted to negotiate with the Universities of
                  Oxford and Cambridge to establish a professorship in Chinese
                  language as a condition of the gift of his library, but was
                  ultimately unsuccessful. As a result, in 1825, he attempted to
                  establish a ‘Universal Language Institution’ in London, a
                  collaboration between the London, Church, Baptist and Wesleyan
                  Missionary Societies. Morrison offered a three-month course of
                  lectures in Chinese to prospective missionaries while Rev.
                  Henry Townley, having recently returned from Calcutta (Chapter
                  6), gave lectures in Bengali.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  In January 1825, <em>Missionary Sketches</em> featured a
                  ‘Bird’s eye view of the Anglo-Chinese College House at
                  Malacca’, describing its history as well as hopes for its
                  future in Singapore.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Morrison met with Raffles in Britain, hopeful of advancing
                  plans for the Singapore Institution, but Raffles died in
                  England during the summer of 1826, shortly after Morrison
                  returned to China that May.

                  Morrison’s library remained at the London Missionary Society
                  until after Morrison died at Canton in 1834, shortly after the
                  East India Company’s trading monopoly in China was abolished.
                  In 1836, shortly after University College London received its
                  royal charter, it accepted Morrison’s library and appointed a
                  Professor in Chinese.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-9-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-9-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  This was to be Samuel Kidd, a former student of Bogue’s at
                  Gosport Academy who had worked at the Anglo-Chinese College
                  between 1824 and 1832, becoming its principal between 1828.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1922, Morrison’s library was transferred on permanent loan
                  to the newly established School of Oriental Studies (today the
                  School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London),
                  in some ways an updated version of the ‘Universal Language
                  Institution’ Morrison attempted to establish a century
                  earlier. The longer history of Morrison’s library is
                  emblematic of a wider story, by which missionary and
                  evangelical forms of knowledge and education became the basis
                  for institutions, that have, in many cases, persisted into our
                  own times. Morrison’s parallel work on his Chinese Dictionary
                  alongside his Bible translation provides an insight into the
                  ways in which Missionary knowledge itself,was sometimes built
                  on commercial foundations.

                <p>
                  Visiting Chicago’s Field Museum in June 2010 to see items
                  purchased from the London Missionary Society’s museum by
                  Captain A.W.F. Fuller during the mid-twentieth century, I was
                  surprised to encounter a number of Australian artefacts – four
                  spears and a club. Having briefly worked on a project in
                  northern Australia in 2003, I knew missionaries played a
                  significant part in Australian history, but associated this
                  with other missionary societies and other places.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The closest the London Missionary Society missions had got to
                  Australia, or so I thought, were the islands of the Torres
                  Strait, lying between Australia’s northeastern tip and Papua
                  New Guinea. Having been sent a scan of Captain Fuller’s
                  personal copy of the
                  <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum,</em> published in the
                  mid-nineteenth century, by the Bishop Museum in Hawai’i, I
                  could see his pencil cross alongside the description for item
                  no. 206, which provides the title for this chapter (he also
                  wrote ‘LM Socy’ in pencil, directly onto the artefact in
                  question – Field Museum accession number 272363 – image
                  above).
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the London Missionary Society’s longer-term history
                  concentrated in Polynesia, Africa, Madagascar, India, China
                  and the West Indies, its first three decades involved
                  engagements in several other parts of the world. Richard
                  Lovett’s (1899)
                  <em>History of the London Missionary Society 1795-1895</em>,
                  published to mark the Society’s first centenary, is structured
                  around these six major ‘mission fields’, but also includes a
                  chapter on ‘Missions Begun and Abandoned During the
                  Century’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  This includes brief accounts of missions to various parts of
                  what is now Canada between 1799 and 1818, to French prisoners
                  of war in 1801, to a brief mission in Buenos Aires in 1807, as
                  well as to Malta and the Ionian Islands of Greece between 1808
                  and 1844 and Mauritius between 1814 and 1871.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Listings of missionaries in the appendices of Lovett’s two
                  volumes also include Joseph Frey, a missionary to the Jews in
                  London between 1805 and 1809, and his China section includes
                  an account of the mission to Mongolia between 1818 and 1840.
                  Nowhere, however, does he refer to a mission to the Aboriginal
                  people of Australia. How did such a quintessentially
                  Australian artefact find its way into the collection of the
                  museum of the London Missionary Society, along with a
                  description that at least appears to include the artefact’s
                  name in an indigenous Australian language?

                  At least part of the answer has to do with Rev. Daniel Tyerman
                  and George Bennet, the deputation sent by the Directors to
                  tour the Society’s missions in May 1821. Having left them at
                  Raiatea in late 1822, following their return from Hawai’i (<a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-principal-kinds-of-native-cloth" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>), we need to pick up their strand in the story. Spending
                  time with the Raiatean king, Tamatoa III, they learned about
                  Polynesian mythology as well as the historic significance of
                  the ‘<em>maro’</em>, a hereditary robe of royalty covered with
                  red feathers to which an additional section was added on the
                  accession of each monarch.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Tyerman and Bennet’s account suggests it ‘might be regarded as
                  an hieroglyphic tablet of the annals of Raiatea’, but noted it
                  had been cast off by Tamatoa and sent ‘as another trophy of
                  the gospel victories here to the Museum of the London
                  Missionary Society’ by the resident missionaries John Williams
                  and Lancelot Threlkeld.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  They visited Opoa, centre of the cult of Oro, and former
                  residence of Tamatoa on Raiatea, describing it as the
                  ‘metropolis of idolatry’, which by late 1822 was ‘flourishing
                  in all the unpruned luxuriance of tropical vegetation’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tyerman and Bennet described the efforts of the people of
                  Raiatea and surrounding islands to establish a Christian way
                  of life, including through the establishment of law courts
                  that punished even those found guilty of being tattooed,
                  consuming kava or leaving offerings for the deceased, at least
                  initially. At the end of 1822 they witnessed the baptism of
                  150 people by John Williams and Lancelot Threlkeld, resident
                  missionaries at Raiatea, and in early 1823 they visited the
                  neighbouring island of Taha’a, where they attended the baptism
                  of 198 people, as well as Borabora where they saw 90 more
                  baptised. At Huahine they joined the annual Missionary meeting
                  where a new code of laws was adopted, travelling to Tahiti in
                  mid-May for the annual Missionary meeting, attended by ‘long
                  lines of people… in their various picturesque dresses’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  The meeting took place in a chapel so large it needed two
                  preachers, where participants donated considerable amounts of
                  coconut oil, arrow-root, cotton and pigs to support further
                  missionary endeavours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following the death of Pomare II in December 1821, a regency
                  was established – Pomare’s son and heir apparently celebrated
                  his third birthday when Tyerman and Bennet were at Tahiti in
                  June 1823. They seem to have met with various senior men in
                  their attempts to ensure the new Christian order would not
                  fall victim to this seeming power vacuum. In September, when
                  meeting a chief called Tati, they were presented with parts of
                  the ‘bonnet and two tawdry coverings which were cast over’ the
                  idol of Oro, as well as a remnant of the ‘<em>maro’</em> used
                  to invest Pomare II as king.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  In October, Bennett acquired a <em>fare na atua</em> or god
                  house: ‘the only relic of the kind that we have seen in these
                  islands; so utter was the demolition of such things even when
                  the idols themselves were preserved for transportation to
                  England as trophies of the triumph of the gospel’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  This example had evidently been hidden by priests in a cave in
                  the mountains, and only recently ‘brought to market and
                  sold’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of October 1823 they went to Mo’orea for six weeks
                  before travelling to Raivavae in the Austral Islands, where
                  they visited newly constructed chapels and witnessed the
                  baptism of 52 people, following which they were presented with
                  a large quantity of bark cloth.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Visiting neighbouring Tubuai in early 1824, they saw more
                  people baptised, despite the island suffering an epidemic
                  disease and having only received Tahitian teachers 18 months
                  earlier.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Returning to Rurutu, where they stopped on their way back from
                  Hawai’i, they attended a church service at which 31 people
                  were baptised. Arriving back at Mo’orea in mid-January and
                  Tahiti in February, Tyerman and Bennet participated in the
                  first Tahitian parliament to include representatives of the
                  common people, convened to consider and adopt a new code of
                  laws. Henry Nott, the Society’s senior missionary, had
                  prepared the laws and presided over the meeting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  While one of the 40 articles adopted proposed to repeal the
                  law against tattooing, ‘leaving it to persons to act as they
                  pleased in respect to that custom’, a major point of debate
                  arose over the establishment of a suitable punishment for
                  murder.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  According to the summary given in Tyerman and Bennet’s
                  account, while some suggested they should follow English
                  precedent by adopting the death penalty, others pointed out
                  that the death penalty was also applied in Britain for
                  burglary and sheep stealing, which self-evidently went too
                  far. Scriptural authority was cited, but Tati, a chief who
                  ‘seemed a pillar of state’, pointed out that ‘many of the laws
                  of the Old Testament had been thrown down by the Lord Jesus
                  Christ’, and argued that the New Testament should be their
                  guide.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Pati, the former chief priest of Oro at Mo’orea, who had been
                  the first to burn his <em>to’o</em> (what the missionaries
                  called ‘idols’), pointed out that for Christians, punishment
                  should not be made for revenge but deterrence, suggesting that
                  banishment to a remote island would be more effective in this
                  regard (whether he had the British example of transportation
                  to Australia in mind is unclear). Finally, a commoner argued
                  that another reason for punishment was ‘to make the offender
                  good again if possible’, noting that ‘if we kill a murderer,
                  how can we make him better?’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  With new laws adopted, Tyerman and Bennet, together with the
                  assembled missionaries, presided over the coronation of the
                  infant king on 21 April 1824, the first Christian installation
                  of its kind in Polynesia. The newly adopted code of laws was
                  read to the assembled subjects by Henry Nott and presented to
                  the boy king by George Bennet. Likewise, after he was anointed
                  and crowned by Nott, Daniel Tyerman presented the new King
                  with a Bible, telling him it was ‘the most valuable thing in
                  the world.’ Sailing shortly afterwards to Mo’orea, Tyerman and
                  Bennet prepared to leave for New South Wales in a small (50
                  ton) schooner, the <em>Endeavour</em>, together with one of
                  the missionaries, Lancelot Threlkeld, who had ‘lately lost his
                  excellent wife’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  On their way, they stopped at the Cook Islands, where they
                  left Tahitian evangelists to continue the work of conversion,

                  After three years spent largely as guests of honour in the
                  newly Christian kingdoms of Polynesia, established around an
                  explicitly missionary religion, the Deputation’s subsequent
                  visits must have been somewhat anticlimactic. On the way to
                  Australia, the <em>Endeavour</em> stopped at Whangaroa Bay in
                  the far North of New Zealand, where a Wesleyan mission had
                  been established a year earlier. The ship’s deck quickly
                  became crowded with Māori visitors, keen to trade, especially
                  for muskets and gunpowder, New Zealand’s ‘musket wars’ in the
                  process of transforming Māori political relationships. It
                  seems likely that some of the 34 Māori artefacts that the
                  British Museum acquired from the London Missionary Society
                  were acquired during trading undertaken at this time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  In the midst of these exchanges, the ship’s cook suddenly
                  cried out that his cooking pans had been stolen, and someone
                  else that the Captain’s trunk had been broken into.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When Captain John Dibbs attempted to clear the deck, one of
                  the visiting Māori dignitaries was knocked into the water. The
                  women and children immediately left and the Māori men
                  surrounded those Europeans on deck, including Bennet, Tyerman
                  and Threlkeld, together with Threlkeld’s seven year old son. A
                  man who had until then been trading with Bennet began to shout
                  ’<em>Tangata New Zealandi tangata kakino?</em>’ (Is the New
                  Zealand man a bad man?). Having learned some Tahitian,
                  intelligible by New Zealand Māori, Bennet was able to reply
                  ‘<em>Kaore Kakino, tangata New Zealand, tangata kapai</em>’
                  (Not bad, the New Zealander is a good man).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Despite being threatened with a large axe, brought for
                  sharpening by the ship’s carpenter, Bennet attempted to
                  demonstrate peaceful intentions by allowing himself to be
                  cheated into buying the same fish repeatedly, for fish hooks
                  taken in his jacket pocket.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually this tension broke when the ship’s boat returned,
                  carrying William White from the Wesleyan mission at Kaeo,
                  together with Te Ara, Principal Chief of Ngati Ura, who
                  defused the situation. Te Ara had himself served on European
                  ships, and his whipping on the <em>Boyd</em> as a crew member
                  is understood to have led to a revenge attack that saw the
                  entire crew killed in Whangaroa Bay, 15 years earlier. Leaving
                  Te Ara on board to ensure the ship’s safety, Tyerman and
                  Bennet visited the mission station, hopeful that the
                  transformations they had seen in Tahiti would soon come to New
                  Zealand. This, however, was something to be overseen by the
                  Wesleyans, as well as the Anglican Church Missionary Society
                  (CMS) who had established a mission at the Bay of Islands a
                  decade earlier, under the oversight of the Rev. Samuel
                  Marsden, Anglican Chaplain at New South Wales.

                  The <em>Endeavour</em> entered Sydney Cove in New South Wales
                  at midnight on 19 August 1824, a little over 54 years after
                  her namesake, HMS <em>Endeavour</em>, arrived at Botany Bay
                  under Captain James Cook. A penal colony had been established
                  in 1788, after American independence meant convicted criminals
                  could no longer be sent across the Atlantic. Free settlers
                  followed in 1793, and by 1824 European settlement extended up
                  to 100 kilometres from the harbour.

                  Tyerman and Bennet were immediately struck by the stone and
                  brick buildings of Sydney, as well as its two Anglican
                  churches, two Methodist meeting houses, as well as Scotch and
                  Roman Catholic chapels. They couldn’t help but notice the many
                  convicts, however, ‘going about their occupations in jackets
                  marked with the broad arrow, or some other badge of their
                  servile condition. They are, for the most part, miserable
                  creatures…’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Having spent three years with ‘no fear for our persons or our
                  property, by day or night’ they became conscious of the need
                  to ‘look well to ourselves and our locks for security’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Threlkeld would have items stolen on three occasions in the
                  following nine months.

                  On 24 August, Tyerman and Bennet visited the Rev. Samuel
                  Marsden at his home in Parramatta (Chapter 4). Having come to
                  Australia before the establishment of the Church Missionary
                  Society (CMS) in 1799, despite his involvement in directing
                  the efforts of the CMS in New Zealand, Marsden remained a
                  Director of the London Missionary Society and its appointed
                  agent in New South Wales. Marsden introduced the visitors to
                  Sir Thomas Brisbane, Governor of New South Wales since 1821.

                  The Deputation visited the factory built nearby for female
                  convicts, but by the end of the month their focus had shifted
                  onto Australia’s indigenous people. Although told by
                  Australian settlers (including Marsden) that earlier attempts
                  to convert and civilise Aboriginal people had demonstrated it
                  to be a hopeless endeavour, Tyerman and Bennet pointed out
                  that the same sentiment had been expressed about the Khoesan
                  peoples of South Africa forty years earlier, among whom there
                  were now thousands of Christians (<a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-mary-john-and-martha" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>

                  should be undertaken in Australia in the same way as it had
                  been in the islands, preaching the gospel to people in their
                  own language. While Aboriginal people had been able to pick up
                  a few phrases in English ‘in mere common-place intercourse

                  No one, from what they could tell, had made any real effort to
                  attempt to learn Australia’s Aboriginal languages.

                  Over a dinner at Marsden’s house on 16 September, they sounded
                  out Governor Brisbane and the colony’s senior administrators,
                  receiving a degree of support for ‘any prudent measure which
                  might be adopted for ameliorating the condition of the
                  aborigines’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  They were told many tales about Aboriginal people, and Tyerman
                  and Bennet’s lobbying efforts, encountered a great deal of
                  resistance, noting that ‘many people who ought to know better
                  are incurably convinced that the New Hollanders are incurably
                  stupid’.⁠<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fn25" id="page-chapter-10-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>

                  They were even told that a prominent land owner at Bathurst
                  had publicly declared that ‘the best use which could be made
                  of “the black fellows” would be, to shoot them all, and manure

                  For Tyerman and Bennet, opposition to missionary work among
                  settlers must have been familiar and recognisable from other
                  colonial settings, not least South Africa (<a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-mary-john-and-martha" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>
                  and
                  <a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-the-giraffe" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>). Such comparisons were also evidently apparent to others
                  with experience across colonial worlds. At a Missionary
                  Meeting of the Wesleyan Church in early October, the recently
                  appointed solicitor-general of the colony, John Stephen,
                  defended preachers in the West Indies ‘from the cruel
                  calumnies of slave-holders and slave-drivers there’, having
                  previously worked as an attorney in Basseterre, Saint Kitts
                  and Nevis.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 18 October 1824, Tyerman and Bennet met with Governor
                  Brisbane and recommended that Lancelot Threlkeld be appointed
                  as missionary to the Aborigines at the new colony being formed
                  at Moreton Bay on the Brisbane River (Threlkeld had originally
                  planned to return to England to find a wife, but since
                  arriving in New South Wales had met and arranged to marry
                  Sarah Arndell, the daughter of Thomas Arndell, Assistant
                  Surgeon with the first fleet). Tyerman and Bennet had recently
                  met an Englishman who had been wrecked and lived at Moreton
                  Bay, who told them the people were more numerous and ‘of a
                  superior order, to the wretched vagrants here, who are
                  degraded below their original wretchedness by their unhappy
                  intercourse with Europeans’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  On his departure, after two years living among them, he had
                  been given a fishing net and a basket by an old man, so that
                  he could feed himself where he was going.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Governor seemed to think that in addition to being a
                  missionary, Threlkeld might act as chaplain at the new
                  settlement, but when told Threlkeld was not a Minister of the
                  Church of England, his attitude seems to have cooled. No space
                  was found for Threlkeld on the ships going to Moreton Bay and
                  in December, Saxe Bannister, the recently appointed Attorney
                  General, told Threlkeld that they had ‘strong enemies behind
                  the curtain’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  On 28 December, the anniversary of the arrival of the colony’s
                  previous Governor, Macquarie, Tyerman, Bennet and Threlkeld
                  attended the feast at Parramatta, arranged for the colony’s
                  Aboriginal people, around 400 of whom attended. Some wore red
                  ochre and white clay on their faces as well as necklaces of
                  reed and kangaroo teeth. They were served roast beef and plum
                  pudding, as well as bread and soup, washed down with half a
                  pint of grog.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  With a mission at the new colony at Moreton Bay (Brisbane)
                  ruled out, Tyerman and Bennet looked for an alternative
                  location, settling on Reid’s Mistake, near Newcastle ‘where
                  the natives were numerous and where the fishing tribes could
                  obtain a plentiful supply of fish from Lake Macquarie’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  On 14 January 1825, they sailed around ten hours north from
                  Sydney to see this location, returning four days later to ask
                  the Governor for his approval. On 24 February 1825, Tyerman
                  and Bennet arranged for their instructions to Threlkeld to be
                  printed and circulated in New South Wales. This stated:

                  Threlkeld’s arrival seems to have been welcomed by the

                <p>
                  After nearly ten months in New South Wales, Tyerman and Bennet
                  arranged to leave in June 1825, with the intention of going on
                  the Society’s missions in Asia. Their stay had been much
                  longer than anticipated, but they felt that ‘circumstances,
                  which appears to be openings of Providence to direct our
                  attention to the perishing and utterly neglected natives of
                  this county, have detained us till this hour’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  On 21 May 1825, Threlkeld wrote in his journal about ‘a trusty
                  native who speaks good English’. On 26 May the same man took
                  him to a suitable location for the mission, a place name
                  recorded by Threlkeld as ‘Bad debah’ (Bahtabah, now part of
                  suburb of Belmont in the City of Lake Macquarie).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was the start of a relationship that laid the foundation
                  for Threlkeld’s subsequent work in Australia. The man in
                  question was known as M’Gill (possibly an anglicisation of
                  Magal) and had spent some of his childhood at the military
                  barracks at Sydney.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fn36" id="page-chapter-10-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  He may have worked at the penal colony at Port Macquarie, but
                  had returned to the Newcastle area by the time Threlkeld
                  arrived. It seems likely that M’Gill directed Threlkeld to
                  establish the mission on land of which he was a traditional
                  custodian.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Life for Aboriginal people in New South Wales was extremely
                  difficult in the early nineteenth century. Between the many
                  male convicts, who preyed on Aboriginal women and girls, and
                  the settlers, keen to exclude Aboriginal people from their
                  grants of land, there were many dangers and very few legal
                  protections. Magistrates were frequently the very same
                  settlers with whom they were in conflict. Having worked as a
                  ‘bush constable’, M’Gill was no stranger to the violence of
                  the young colony and he seems to have deliberately cultivated
                  Threlkeld as an advocate for his people, while teaching him
                  his language.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When Threlkeld witnessed an Aboriginal burial shortly after
                  his arrival, he was asked not to tell anyone the location of
                  the grave, since they feared a white fellow would come and
                  take the deceased woman’s head away. Threlkeld connected this
                  to the Maori heads he had seen for sale in Sydney, part of the
                  trade for guns and powder during ‘the musket wars’, but was
                  soon to learn that there was also a trade in Aboriginal heads
                  operating in New South Wales. By spending much of each day in
                  conversation with M’Gill, who he referred to in later years as
                  his tutor, Threlkeld heard stories and rumours of the deadly
                  violence unfolding across the colony. It was not long before
                  Threlkeld witnessed violent acts himself.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In December 1825, Threlkeld was alerted to the sound of an
                  Englishman beating an Aboriginal man, who had tried to stop
                  him abducting his ten year old daughter. When Threlkeld tried
                  to report the assault, his concerns were essentially dismissed
                  by the magistrates. When asked by Saxe Bannister at around the
                  same time about rumours of Aboriginal violence in Hunter
                  River, Threlkeld could only say that he was surprised that
                  ‘more Whites are not speared than there are considering the
                  gross provocation given’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the first half of 1826, M’Gill left Threlkeld for
                  several weeks. He went into the mountains to participate in a
                  ceremony, taking with him around 60 spears that he intended to
                  exchange for possum skin cord. According to Threlkeld, he
                  attended a ceremony at around this time ‘which has initiated
                  him into all the rights of an Aborigine’. Despite spending
                  some of his early life among the settlers, M’Gill was in the
                  process of acquiring the authority to act as a leader among
                  his people.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of September 1826, Threlkeld and his family moved
                  to the house that had been built for them at the place he now
                  wrote as ‘Ba-ta-ba’, having briefly also written ‘Biddobar’.
                  In April 1827 he arranged for the printing at Sydney of
                  <em>Specimens of A Dialect of the Aborigines of New South
                    Wales; being the first attempt to form their speech into a
                    written language</em>. Threlkeld signs the Preface from ‘Bah-tah-bah’, and the
                  text bears the fingerprints of M’Gill, now increasingly known
                  as Biraban (which appears in the text as Berabahn, translated
                  as Eagle hawk).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By this time, Threlkeld was engaged in a difficult and
                  protracted correspondence with the Directors of the Missionary
                  Society in London, who had become alarmed at the extremely
                  high costs of establishing this new mission in New South Wales
                  – around £500 a year including clothes, tea, sugar, tobacco
                  and fish hooks paid to Aboriginal people to work at the
                  mission. Threlkeld found that without such inducements they
                  were unlikely to stick around for long, given the lure of
                  nearby Newcastle – evidently a source of plentiful alcohol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Directors suggested that unless the New South Wales
                  government funded some of these expenses, as originally
                  anticipated, Threlkeld should return to the Islands. When his
                  bills were not paid by the Society’s Secretary in London,
                  Threlkeld was arrested at Sydney in November 1827. Concerned
                  at characterisations of his mission as extravagant and
                  ultimately hopeless, Threlkeld attempted to appeal to British
                  history, arguing in a circular he had printed in 1828, that:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>It may be said, with truth, respecting the Aborigines of
                    this land, – treat them as savages, and they will act as
                    savages; – treat them as Men, and they will act as men. We
                    view the conduct of Charactacus, leading the Aboriginal
                    Britons and opposing the invading Romans with applause, and
                    Boadicea, queen of an Aboriginal tribe, with her eighty
                    thousand English slaughtered by insulting conquerors with
                    sympathy. But the Aborigines of Australia, who have no
                    combined numbers, no political power, to render themselves
                    respected, or rather feared, by the invaders of their
                    country, are driven, indirectly, from their districts, as
                    other wild beasts of the deserts, without Sympathy, when the
                    civilized hand cultivates their soil!</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Threlkeld continued his language work while
                  attempting to defend his expenditure, he was informed by a
                  letter he received in December 1828 that the LMS Directors had
                  decided to abandon the mission. They even subsequently
                  instructed Samuel Marsden to place an advertisement in the
                  Sydney Gazette, which declared that the London Missionary
                  Society was discontinuing the Mission at Lake Macquarie, as
                  well as their connection with Threlkeld. Ultimately, the new
                  Governor of the colony, Darling, agreed to support Threlkeld’s
                  mission, although it was relocated to land Threlkeld was
                  granted in a personal capacity on the other side of Lake
                  Macquarie. It became known as the Ebenezer Mission and
                  continued until 1841.

                  Was the club, now at the Field Museum in Chicago, collected by
                  Threlkeld during the short years the London Missionary Society
                  supported his mission at Bahtabah? Threlkeld had been actively
                  involved in collecting for the Missionary Museum in the
                  Society Islands, so it is likely he would have continued
                  collecting things in New South Wales. Much later, in 1851, he
                  even took an active part in organising a missionary exhibition
                  in Sydney.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  The ‘Tur Rursna’ does not appear in the earliest surviving
                  <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum</em>, but given the
                  long journey between London and New South Wales, it could have
                  arrived soon after the catalogue was published in 1826.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alternatively, was it collected by Daniel Tyerman or George
                  Bennet and given to the Missionary Museum together with other
                  items they collected during their deputation? George Bennet
                  returned to Britain in 1829 (Tyerman died in Madagascar in
                  July 1828) and is known to have given a spear thrower, club
                  and shield from coastal New South Wales to the Sheffield
                  Literary and Philosophical Society (established 1822) as well
                  as a ’Wooden Instrument used by the Aborigines of New Holland,
                  to assist in throwing their Spears’ to the Leeds Philosophical
                  and Literary Society (established 1820).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Might the club have been collected by Tyerman and Bennet, and
                  only subsequently connected with the term ‘Tur Rursna’?
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is hard to be sure of the ultimate origin of the club, but
                  the inclusion of the Aboriginal term <em>Tur Rursna</em> in
                  the later version of the catalogue, published around 1860,
                  remains the best clue we have. The Cuming family collection,
                  assembled in London from 1806 onwards, includes a boomerang
                  acquired around 1840 with an attached label that reads:
                </p>
                <p>
                  TUR-RUR-MA called by Europeans Boomerang. When thrown into the
                  air, it revolves on its centre and returns, forming a circle
                  in orbit from and to the thrower.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The term ’tur-rur-ma’ had, by then, featured in a list of
                  common nouns given in
                  <em>An Australian Grammar,</em> published by Lancelot
                  Threlkeld at Sydney in 1834. There it was described as:
                </p>
                <p>
                  An instrument of war, called by Europeans Boomering, of a half
                  moon shape, which when thrown in the air, revolves on its own
                  centre, and returns forming a circle in its Orbit from and to
                  the thrower, to effect which it is thrown against the wind;
                  but, in war it is thrown against the ground which it strikes
                  in its revolution and rebounds apparently with double
                  violence, and strikes at random some distant object, and
                  wounds severely with its sharpened extremities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                  Given the closeness of these texts, it seems likely that the
                  information written on the Cuming boomerang came from
                  Threlkeld’s <em>Grammar</em>. Interestingly, a list of names
                  of common places in the same text includes ‘But-ta-ba’ with
                  the meaning given as ‘The name of a hill on the margin of the
                  lake’. Threlkeld’s introduction to the <em>Grammar</em> makes
                  the case for the kind of detailed linguistic work he was doing
                  with Biraban, partly by including a list of what he calls
                  ‘Barbarisms’ – words pretending to be of Aboriginal origin,
                  but which have likely arisen out of misunderstanding:

                  While whoever wrote the label for the Cuming Museum had almost
                  certainly seen Threlkeld’s <em>Australian Grammar</em>, this
                  doesn’t necessarily mean it was unrelated to items in the
                  Missionary Museum. In 1839, Henry Syer Cuming wrote to the LMS
                  Directors complaining about the miserable state of the
                  Missionary Museum, offering his services to help in arranging
                  the museum and identifying the localities from which items
                  came if they would remunerate him for his services.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Did he acquire a boomerang for his personal collection in
                  return for his curatorial services, and was it through
                  consulting the Society’s library, containing linguistic works
                  by their former missionary Threlkeld, that he discovered the
                  term <em>Tur-rur-ma</em>?
                </p>
                <p>
                  It might seem unlikely that Threlkeld would have sent his
                  publications to London given the circumstances in which he was
                  so acrimoniously and publicly dismissed. However, in 1830,
                  William Ellis, who originally left England for the Pacific
                  with Threlkeld in 1816, was appointed Assistant Foreign
                  Secretary of the Missionary Society in London, and in 1832
                  became its Chief Foreign Secretary (<a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-13-all-wrapped-up-in-a-piece-of-tahitian-cloth" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite having fallen out with the Society’s Directors,
                  Threlkeld appears to have remained on friendly terms with
                  Ellis, asking him to show the Missionary Museum to several
                  friends visiting London.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  In 1838, having recently been involved in establishing an
                  Auxiliary society to raise funds for the Society in Australia,
                  Threlkeld suggested that William Westbrooke Burton, a judge at
                  the Supreme Court of New South Wales returning to London on
                  leave, visit the Missionary Museum, where:
                </p>

                  <em>My former colleague the Revd Willm Ellis the Foreign
                    Secretary to the Society will feel much pleasure in giving
                    explanations respecting the many curious articles to be seen
                    at the Society’s Museum</em>.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>

                <p>
                  On 23 May 1840, Threlkeld wrote to Ellis from Ebenezer Mission
                  on Lake Macquarie, suggesting that he was making up ‘a packet
                  for the Directors &amp;c &amp;c which I hope to get conveyed
                  by some Captain to the Rooms’. Did this packet include
                  Aboriginal weapons, or did it just include his texts on
                  Aboriginal languages, printed at Sydney?
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of the
                  <em>Annual Report of the Mission to Aborigines, Lake
                    Macquarie</em>
                  for the year 1839, Threlkeld offers a comparison of the
                  dialects spoken by Aboriginal people, which suggests that
                  ‘Tur-rur-ma’ may have been quite a localised term, with even
                  people living inland from Newcastle at Manilla River using a
                  different term:

                  In 1854-55, Threlkeld, then Minister of the Mariner’s Church
                  at Sydney, published a series of ‘Reminiscences’ in
                  <em>The Christian Herald.</em> One, published on 31 March
                  1855, went under the title:
                  <em>Warlike Implements, the Tur-rur-ma, or Boomerang.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Commenting on the biblical prophecy that ‘The nations shall
                  beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into
                  pruning-hooks’,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  Threlkeld pointed out that the indigenous people of New South
                  Wales formerly had no metal weapons. The text then describes:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    an instrument of warfare called <em>Yir-ra</em>, in reality,
                    a very simple wooden sword. At first when I saw one, I
                    mistook it for a Boommerang, the shape in the blade being
                    very much like that weapon. There was, however this
                    difference, the Boommerang is alike at both ends, the wooden
                    sword has a handle at one end with a bend contrary to the
                    blade.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Threlkeld draws attention to an image recently published in
                  Joseph Bonomi’s (1852)
                  <em>Nineveh and its Palaces (Figure 42)</em>. This he states:
                </p>
                <p>
                  is not the <em>Australian</em> Bommereng, but the Australian
                  <em>wooden sword.</em> The difference of shape appears to be
                  only an accidental circumstance arising from the natural
                  growth of the tree whence the wooden sword is taken.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fnNaN" id="page-chapter-10-fnrefnan" class="footnote-ref-anchor">NaN</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Threlkeld comments on the term ‘Boomerrang’, suggesting ‘The
                  Orthography of this barbarism, for it is not an aboriginal
                  term, but like many others, is a pure invention palmed upon
                  the Blacks, as belonging to their classic lore’. Instead,
                  Threlkeld suggests that ‘the proper aboriginal name’ is
                  <em>Tur-rur-ma,</em> a term he almost certainly learned from
                  Biraban.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It seems likely that <em>Tur Rursna</em> as it appears in the
                  catalogue of the Missionary Museum is either a misreading of
                  ‘Tur-rur-ma’, written onto a label, or else is one of
                  Threlkeld’s earlier attempts at transcription – like the many
                  different ways in which he wrote the place name Bahtabah.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Threlkeld’s <em>Reminiscences</em> suggest that the club now
                  at Chicago’s Field Museum is not in fact a
                  <em>Tur-rur-ma</em>, since it clearly has a handle at one end.
                  Neither does it appear to be a <em>Yir-ra</em>, or wooden
                  sword, since its angular profile is unlike the image he
                  identifies as one, nor is it like other early examples
                  recently identified in British museum collections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-10-fn53" id="page-chapter-10-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  While we may never definitively know the ultimate origins of
                  this artefact, we can be fairly certain that these words,
                  translations from a living and spoken Aboriginal language into
                  a written form, arose from the friendship Biraban established
                  with Threlkeld on 21 May 1825.

                  I am extremely grateful to Gaye Sculthorpe for pointing out
                  that the club is not what Threlkeld called a ‘Yir-ra’, based
                  on her recent work, for providing information on Bennet’s
                  gifts of Australian items to the Sheffield Literary and
                  Philosophical Society, as well as for connecting me with
                  Daniel Simpson and Eleanor Foster who were working on related
                  areas. I am extremely grateful to Danny for pointing out the
                  use of ‘Tur-rur-ma’ in relation to the Cuming Museum
                  boomerang, now at Saffron Walden, as well as within
                  Threlkeld’s linguistic work. I am grateful to Eleanor for
                  sharing her dissertation, and for her generous acknowledgement
                  of my prior work on this club.

                  In the more distant past, I spent the best part of 2003 in
                  Australia, where I learnt a great deal about Australian
                  Aboriginal life from Nicolas Peterson, as well as Howard
                  Morphy at the ANU. It was during that time that I first came
                  across Niel Gunson’s compilation of material on Threlkeld.
                  This chapter is a somewhat late return-prestation,
                  acknowledging the impact that the time I spent in Australia
                  has had on my subsequent work.

                  The caption from which this chapter takes its title comes from
                  the final page of the ‘EAST INDIES’ section of the Missionary
                  Museum catalogue, printed in London in 1826.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn1" id="page-chapter-11-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  The section begins with descriptions of 21 ‘models of HINDOO
                  DEITIES’, sent from Calcutta by Henry Townley in 1819 (Chapter
                  6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn2" id="page-chapter-11-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  This caption, however, doesn’t describe an Indian god, but
                  rather a key figure in Christian, or at least Catholic
                  religious art: the Virgin Mary with the infant Jesus.

                  The inclusion of this item in the Missionary Museum
                  illustrates a confrontation between Protestant missionary
                  activity and Catholicism which occurred in many places around
                  the world, but is also suggestive of a longer conflict in
                  relation to the function of religious images, beginning in
                  Europe itself. This conflict underpinned the northern European
                  Reformation of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in
                  which Protestantism took shape, and seems to have conditioned
                  the way that LMS missionaries responded to religious ‘idols’,
                  whenever and wherever they were encountered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Writing about missionary encounters in the Dutch East Indies,
                  now Indonesia, Webb Keane has described this conflict in terms
                  of a clash of semiotic ideologies, suggesting that
                  Protestantism developed a moral narrative of modernity, by
                  which people were understood to be progressively emancipated
                  through their detachment from material forms – a narrative
                  that shaped notions of ‘fetishism’ later in the nineteenth
                  century and arguably continues to underpin contemporary
                  imaginings of secular modernity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn3" id="page-chapter-11-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>

                  In many ways it is the Virgin Mary and Child, among all the
                  artefacts listed in the 1826 catalogue, that allows us to
                  unpack the fundamental problem that the London Missionary
                  Society had with ‘idols’ – objects that formed a focus for
                  acts of religious worship – and the reasons these became a
                  dominant focus for missionary collecting during the middle of
                  the nineteenth century.

                  Following the re-opening of the Missionary Museum at Austin
                  Friars in August 1824, the considerable costs of ‘building the
                  museum’ (£417) generated concern within the Society.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn4" id="page-chapter-11-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Should funds raised to support overseas missionary work be
                  used to enable the preservation and display of artefacts in
                  London? Writing from Raiatea in the Pacific on 20 November
                  1823, the missionaries Lancelot Threlkeld (<a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-10-two-of-the-tur-rursna" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>) and John Williams (<a href="#page-https-argonauts2022-net-12-a-gigantic-idol" target="_blank">Chapter 12</a>) declared as part of their appeal for a missionary ship:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Did you know the state of the surrounding islands, how ripe
                    they are for the reception of the gospel, you would sell the
                    very gods out of your Museum, if it were necessary to afford
                    the means of carrying the glad tidings of salvation to those
                    now sitting in darkness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn5" id="page-chapter-11-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  A catalogue of the museum’s contents was compiled and printed,
                  sales of which were intended to ‘to diminish the expense
                  incurred by the preparation and support of the Museum’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn6" id="page-chapter-11-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  The catalogue’s price was not fixed, but left to the
                  ‘liberality’ of museum visitors, with a donations box located
                  in the museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn7" id="page-chapter-11-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  By May 1825, the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> reported that
                  this had returned 57 pounds seven shillings and five
                  pence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn8" id="page-chapter-11-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sadly, there are no known copies of this original 1824
                  catalogue, but the British Library retains a copy of the
                  slightly later 1826 version.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn9" id="page-chapter-11-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  This makes it possible to gain a sense of how the collections
                  had grown in the twelve years since John Campbell returned to
                  Britain from South Africa with his giraffe (Chapter 3), as
                  well as many other things, initiating the establishment of the
                  Missionary Museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The title page of the catalogue provides a guide to what may
                  be found in the museum, listing three main categories:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Specimens in Natural History</li>
                  <li>Various Idols of Heathen Nations</li>
                  <li>
                    Dresses, Manufactures, Domestic Utensils, Instruments of
                    War, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  This is followed by an ‘Advertisement’ providing more
                  background on the museum and its collection, explaining that
                  the articles composing the museum were supplied chiefly by
                  Missionaries of the London Missionary Society, with a few
                  others being donations from ‘benevolent travellers, or
                  friendly officers of mercantile vessels’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn10" id="page-chapter-11-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  It then explains the three categories of material set out on
                  the previous page, suggesting that:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>The Missionaries rightly judged that the natural
                    productions of the distant countries in which they reside
                    would be acceptable at home, especially to the juvenile
                    friends, and to others who may not have opportunity of
                    viewing larger Collections</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn11" id="page-chapter-11-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natural History, although it formed a significant dimension of
                  John Campbells’ original collections, are effectively
                  dismissed as curiosities chiefly of interest to children. It
                  then goes on:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>The efforts also of natural genius, especially in countries
                    rude and uncivilised, afford another class of interesting
                    curiosities; whilst they prove how capable even the most
                    uncivilised of mankind are of receiving that instruction
                    which it is the study of Missionaries to communicate</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn12" id="page-chapter-11-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ‘Dresses, Manufactures, Domestic Utensils and Instruments
                  of War, &amp;c. &amp;C. &amp;c.’, through examples such as
                  finely worked samples of bark cloth brought by William Ellis
                  from Hawaii (Chapter 7), essentially demonstrate potential – a
                  capacity for conversion, but also to be schooled in
                  civilisation – though this argument seems to have concentrated
                  on ‘countries rude and uncivilised’ – which in this context
                  seems to have referred largely to Africa and the Pacific.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Presumably penned by a professional preacher, the
                  Advertisement altered the order outlined on the title page so
                  that the third category to be described delivers the
                  rhetorical hammer blow in a new paragraph:
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the most valuable and impressive objects in this
                  Collection are the numerous, and (in some instances)
                  <em>horrible</em> IDOLS, which have been imported from the
                  South Seas Islands, from India, China, and Africa; and among
                  these, those especially which were actually given up by their
                  former worshippers, from
                  <em>a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry</em> –
                  a conviction derived from the ministry of the Gospel by the
                  Missionaries.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn13" id="page-chapter-11-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Value here is accorded to ‘Idols’ over and above either
                  Natural History or ‘efforts of natural genius’, but special
                  emphasis is given to those given up by their former
                  worshippers, especially when this came from
                  <em>‘a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry’.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn14" id="page-chapter-11-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Protestant evangelicals, the removal of any ‘idols’ may
                  have seemed a good in and of itself, but real value was
                  connected to objects which demonstrated the purpose of the
                  Missionary Society, as set out in its founding constitution of
                  1795 (Chapter 1):
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>The sole object is to spread the knowledge of Christ among
                    the heathen and other unenlightened nations</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn15" id="page-chapter-11-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this light, ‘idols’ sent to the Missionary Museum by
                  converted ‘heathen’ on the basis of conviction and a change of
                  heart – indicators of sincere conversion – were by far the
                  most valuable and impressive objects in the collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Advertisement explicitly connects the display of these
                  ‘singularly interesting objects’ to Pomare’s despatch of his
                  ‘idol gods’ from Tahiti to London in 1816 (Chapter 4), quoting
                  Pomare’s suggestion that missionaries ‘send them to Britain,
                  that the English people might see what foolish gods they had
                  been accustomed to adore’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn16" id="page-chapter-11-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  In displaying these in their Museum, the Directors of the
                  Society were doing no more than complying with Pomare’s
                  wishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The final paragraph of the Advertisement expresses a desire
                  that these ‘trophies of Christianity’ will:
                </p>

                  <em>inspire the spectators with gratitude to God for his
                    goodness to our native land, in favouring us so abundantly
                    with the means of grace, and the knowledge of his salvation
                    and at the same time, with thankfulness that these blessings
                    have, in some happy degree, been communicated, and by our
                    means, to the distant isles of the Southern Ocean</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn17" id="page-chapter-11-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The means of grace received in the British Isles by ancestors,
                  generations previously, was connected, as it had been at the
                  foundation of the Society in 1795 (Chapter 1), to the forward
                  extension and communication of these blessings to other parts
                  of the world. The final sentence of the Advertisement,
                  presumably originally written in 1824 suggested:

                  Keane’s moral narrative of modernity is briefly set out here
                  in grand historical terms for an assumed audience of British
                  Christians – ‘our’ ancestors were vassals of ignorance and
                  superstition but by the grace of God ‘we’ have reached a state
                  of liberation that creates an obligation to liberate others
                  still bound by these same chains.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A listing of individual items forms the body of the catalogue
                  which follows, but on the final page of the catalogue an
                  appeal for ‘Annual Subscriptions, or Donations, in aid of the
                  Funds of this Society’ is followed by the ‘Form of a Bequest’.
                  This included a blank space for an amount to be entered,
                  allowing visitors whose missionary zeal had been inspired by
                  their visit to the museum provide a legacy for the
                  Society.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn19" id="page-chapter-11-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>

                  In 1826, the Missionary Museum was in the process of being
                  reimagined as an extension of the fundraising work that
                  underpinned all aspects of the London Missionary Society’s
                  operations. The title page and Advertisement establishing a
                  framework through which visitors would be expected to engage
                  with the museum and its collections, categorising and valuing
                  the materials on display, but also providing a narrative in
                  which the visitor – assumed to be not only British, but also
                  Protestant and most likely evangelical, or at least
                  sympathetic – could play a part.

                  Prefiguring the secularised narratives of progress that would
                  shape the museums and displays of the later nineteenth
                  century, in relation to what Tony Bennett has called ‘the
                  exhibitionary complex’, this script of liberating Grace has
                  parts for missionaries, supporters, converts as well as
                  idols.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn20" id="page-chapter-11-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  But how well do the artefacts listed on the pages of the
                  catalogue play their allotted parts?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Individual scenes, including Campbell’s giraffe (Chapter 3),
                  Pomare’s idols (Chapter 4) and Ellis’ Hawaiian bark cloth
                  (Chapter 7) appear to conform to these categories, but taken
                  as a whole, how far do the listings of the 1826 catalogue
                  reflect the <em>Advertisment’s</em> exposition?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Considered in numerical terms, both ‘specimens in Natural
                  History’ (117 listings) and ‘efforts of natural genius’ (323
                  listings) outnumbered ‘Idols’ (110 listings) among the 550
                  artefacts listed in the catalogue. Geographically, the largest
                  number came from Africa (163 listings), with twice as many
                  ‘efforts of natural genius’ (111 listings) as ‘specimens in
                  Natural History’ (52 listings), but no ‘Idols’. Next came the
                  Pacific (135 listings), with a good number of ‘Idols’ (45
                  listings), but still more ‘efforts of natural genius’ (89
                  listings). This is followed by China (87 listings), with a
                  third as many ‘Idols’ (19 listings) as ‘efforts of natural
                  genius’ (60 listings), although this figure includes quite a
                  number of books (17 listings), such as the Chinese dictionary
                  of Robert Morrison (Chapter 9).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other geographical areas, such as Australia (Chapter 10),
                  Madagascar (Chapter 19) and the Americas include far smaller
                  numbers of items (107 combined total listings), but these
                  don’t include any items that can be categorised as ‘Idols’,
                  apart from possibly the PEHI rattle from Demerara (Chapter 5).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only among artefacts listed as coming from the ‘East Indies’
                  (58 listings in total) is there a clear predominance of
                  ‘Idols’ (45 listings). Indeed, the number of ‘Idols’ is the
                  same as from the Pacific (45 listings), with much smaller
                  numbers of ‘specimens in Natural History’ (6 listings) and
                  ‘efforts of natural genius’ (7 listings). But how far do these
                  ‘Indian idols’ represent what the ADVERTISEMENT called
                  ’valuable and impressive objects… actually given up by their
                  former worshippers, from a full conviction of the folly and
                  sin of idolatry’?
                </p>
                <p>
                  21 of the 45 ‘Idols’ listed were ‘models’, most likely
                  commissioned by Henry Townley in Calcutta (Chapter 6).
                  Following these in the catalogue is, intriguingly, is a
                  listing for:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>A Case of REJECTED IDOLS from Cuddapah, in the East
                    Indies</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn21" id="page-chapter-11-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  John Hands began preaching and establishing schools at
                  Cuddapah (Kadapa) in 1822, and a mission was established there
                  by William Howell in 1824.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn22" id="page-chapter-11-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  It seems likely that these items were sent to London when a
                  small number of people were baptised, according to an account
                  published later in the century (1858) ‘from doubtful
                  motives’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn23" id="page-chapter-11-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After this, the catalogue includes a fairly large number of
                  items from Rangoon (Yangon – 19 listings), including 13
                  Buddhas, two figures of Krishna, a figure of Kali standing on
                  the stomach of Shiva, a stone lingam, and a set of bells from
                  one of the temples. Beginning a listing for the ‘Fourth Shelf’
                  was a gilt Buddha from Rangoon, described as ‘a Sea Port in
                  the Burmese Empire’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn24" id="page-chapter-11-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  This was followed by a long text describing Buddha as an
                  avatar of Vishu, taken from a Sanskrit inscription at Bodh
                  Gaya, translated by Charles Wilkins, which appeared in the
                  first volume of
                  <em>Asiatick Researches, published at Calcutta by the Asiatic
                    Society of Bengal in 1788.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn25" id="page-chapter-11-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A very brief mission had been established at Rangoon in 1810,
                  but within months one of the missionaries, J.C. Brain, had
                  died and the other Edward Pritchett returned to Madras. Given
                  how short this unsuccessful mission was, it seems extremely
                  unlikely that all these items could have been collected at
                  that time, especially as it predated the establishment of the
                  Missionary Museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rather, a hint at the likely source of these items comes from
                  a list of thanks, published in the
                  <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> of August 1826, stating:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Also, to Mr. Heritage and others of the Society’s Friends,
                    connected with the Congregation at Union Chapel, Calcutta;
                    for several Burmese Idols (some of which were formerly in
                    the large Pagoda at Rangoon), and other valuable curiosities
                    for the Society’s Museum</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn26" id="page-chapter-11-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mr Heritage appears to have been a fairly long-term resident
                  of Calcutta, described in 1832 as the Commander of the Hon.
                  Company’s pilot schooner <em>Henry Meriton</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn27" id="page-chapter-11-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  This normally guided vessels on the Hooghly River, between the
                  sea and Calcutta, making Mr Heritage what the Advertisement
                  described as a ‘friendly officer’ of a mercantile vessel. In
                  May 1824, however, this pilot schooner had been equipped with
                  a pair of canons and joined the hastily assembled fleet to
                  transport troops, together with their howitzers, to Rangoon
                  (Yangon) as part of the first Anglo-Burmese war.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn28" id="page-chapter-11-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The famous golden Shwegadon Pagoda became the military
                  headquarters of the invading troops, who comprehensively
                  pillaged it. It seems likely, therefore that ‘Mr. Heritage and
                  others of the Society’s Friends’ acquired these ‘Burmese
                  Idols’ either as a direct result of their participation in the
                  invasion of Rangoon, or from soldiers returning from the
                  conflict with loot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The forced removal of these items as part of military action
                  is not made explicit in the Missionary Museum catalogue,
                  although the degree to which this implicit provenance would
                  have been understood by those reading the catalogue in the
                  years immediately after the war is unclear. From our
                  perspective, the discrepancy between the display of these
                  items and the ninth commandment –
                  <em>Thou shalt not steal</em> – is striking, but perhaps this
                  was felt to be balanced by the second and third commandments –
                  <em>Thou shalt have no other gods before me</em> and
                  <em>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the list of items taken from Rangoon, a short note in
                  the catalogue suggests that:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>In the front of the larger idols are several smaller ones,
                    of silver, brass, copper, and stone: also a curious censer,
                    of spoon for incense</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn29" id="page-chapter-11-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These likely relate to an early arrival at the museum – back
                  in April 1816 the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> announced that
                  Mr Hands had sent the Directors ‘a number of idols of silver,

                  gospel, written in leaves: Christ’s Sermon on the Mount, in

                  John Hands began work there in 1810, where he set about
                  translating the Bible into Canarese, so it seems likely the
                  gospel was one on which he had worked. The first convert was
                  only recorded in 1819, however, and the letter he sent with
                  the items in September 1815 explained that ‘he cannot gratify
                  them with an account of the poor Hindus around him having
                  openly embraced the gospel’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn31" id="page-chapter-11-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                  With the possible exception of the ‘REJECTED IDOLS from
                  Cuddapah’, neither the idols from Ballary, the looted material
                  from Rangoon, nor the models from Calcutta were given up
                  voluntarily by converts to Christianity. Nevertheless, the
                  catalogue rounded off its listing of Indian ‘Idols’ by
                  reprinting the text which had appeared in
                  <em>Missionary Sketches</em> in 1819, following the
                  descriptions of Townley’s ‘models’ citing Psalm cxv. 5-10:
                  ‘These are specimens, Christian Reader, of the gods of the
                  heathen in India worshipped by more than a hundred millions of
                  deluded people. These are the creatures of a corrupt
                  imagination, and the workmanship of men’s hands…’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following this, a paragraph from Ward’s
                  <em>Account of the Writings, Religion, and Manners of the
                    Hindoos including Translations from their Principal
                    Works</em>
                  was printed in the catalogue:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Nine-tenths of the whole Hindu population pay no
                    conscientious regard whatever to the forms of their
                    religion, and yet the various cruelties accompanying their
                    superstitions occasion the death of more than ten thousand
                    persons every year. And notwithstanding the veneration in
                    which some pretend to hold their gods, yet many, especially
                    the poor, take the liberty of abusing them. When it thunders
                    awfully, respectable Hindoos say, “Oh! the gods are giving
                    us a bad day;” the lower orders say, “The rascally gods are
                    dying.” During a heavy rain, a woman of respectable class
                    frequently says, “Let the gods perish! my clothes are all
                    wet.” A man of low castes says, “These rascally gods are
                    sending more rain.” Ward. vol.1 p.xc

                  Two lines, one thick, mark an ending of sorts for the ‘EAST
                  INDIES’ section of the
                  <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum</em>, but in the
                  remaining space of the page follows the description with which
                  this chapter began:
                </p>

                  <em>THE VIRGIN MARY AND CHILD, from Mysore, that belonged to
                    two Native Roman Catholics, who embraced the Christian
                    religion, and sent the same to the Missionary Society</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beneath this a further paragraph appears in quotation marks:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>“The people were in great consternation at the removal of
                    the image, and offered large sums of money for it; one
                    offered twenty pagodas, another his daughter, and another
                    even declared he would sell his own child and procure money
                    enough to purchase it, if it might be retained; but a deaf
                    ear was turned to the proposals, being aware of the danger
                    of making it an object of worship, and felt as the disciples
                    of Christ,- constrained to take it away.”</em>

                  Given that the publication referred to appeared in the same
                  year as the <em>Catalogue</em> was printed, I initially
                  wondered whether the inclusion of this text after the thick
                  black line suggested an addition to an already prepared
                  printing block. However, given that the items from Rangoon
                  were reported even later in the same year (August), but were
                  incorporated into the main section of the East Indies section,
                  I now think that the lines serve to deliberately demarcate a
                  Christian ‘idol’ from the ‘heathen’ idols that preceded it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The paragraph in quotes comes from a printed version of a
                  letter, originally sent to the Society’s secretary on 23 July
                  1825 and signed by the London Missionary Society’s three
                  European missionaries at Bangalore, Hiram Chambers, William
                  Campbell and Stephen Laidler. It explained:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>We are permitted at this time to lay before you, two
                    trophies of the victorious power of divine truth over the
                    delusions of the Antichrist; trophies which we hope and
                    trust may prove powerful auxiliaries in making known Christ
                    and Him crucified, to their perishing fellow-men</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn33" id="page-chapter-11-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Antichrist was not a gruesome Heathen deity, but rather
                  the Catholic Church, and the two ‘trophies’ were not ‘idols’,
                  but rather two young men who had converted to Protestant
                  Christianity and who, it was hoped, would play a part in
                  converting others. Christianity’s roots in south India are
                  believed to go back to the arrival of St Thomas the apostle in
                  the first century, but the roots of Catholicism in Mysore are
                  generally traced to the establishment of a Mysore mission by
                  Father Leonardo Cinnami in 1649.

                  Following a visit to Bangalore (Bengaluru) by John Hands, from
                  his mission station at Bellary (Ballard), 300 kilometres away,
                  Stephen Laidler had established a mission there for the LMS in
                  1820. With access to the Indian town prohibited to European
                  missionaries by the Rajah of Mysore, preaching was initially
                  directed at the Europeans and Sepoys in the military
                  cantonment. This seems to have changed, however, after the
                  arrival at the mission of Samuel Flavel, who actively preached
                  in surrounding villages, distributing tracts and copies of the
                  gospels in local languages.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn34" id="page-chapter-11-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>

                  Born at Quilon (Kollam) on the Malabar Coast of Kerala in
                  1787, Shunkurulingam, as he was known before he was baptised,
                  was employed by a British officer at a fairly young age. He
                  travelled widely in India, visiting Mauritius before being
                  employed in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) as a butler. He came across a
                  translation of the Gospels into Tamil which initiated a
                  personal quest to know more about Protestant Christianity.
                  This led to his baptism at Tellicherry (Thalassery) by an East
                  India Company chaplain, when he adopted the name Samuel.
                  Invited by Laidler to join the new mission at Bangalore,
                  Samuel became central to its work. He was ordained as the
                  pastor of the native church in 1822, when he adopted the
                  surname Flavel at Laidler’s suggestion. John Flavel, like his
                  Indian namesake, had been a learned Puritan minister, famous
                  for preaching in the face of official prohibition.

                  The letter, written at Bangalore in July 1825, and printed in
                  the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> in January 1826, concerns an
                  event that took place in the city of Mysore (Mysuru), with
                  none of the three European missionaries present. Samuel Flavel
                  had made the journey of nearly 150 kilometres at the
                  invitation of two brothers who were catechists at the city’s
                  Roman Catholic Church.

                  Five years previously they had talked with Joshua, an Indian
                  convert connected to the London Missionary Society, which led
                  them to question Catholic practice. The elder of the two was,
                  according to the account given, flogged by the priest for his
                  impertinence – an example of what the letter refers to ‘the
                  carnal weapons of Antichrist’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn35" id="page-chapter-11-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>

                  Visited in April 1824 by another Indian convert, John, who had
                  recently been baptised at Bangalore, the elder brother wrote
                  to Flavel, asking for a meeting. Flavel told the European
                  missionaries that when he arrived in Mysore, the Catholic
                  congregation had been commanded by the priest not to speak to
                  him, who described him as ‘the greatest devil he had known
                  among the Protestants’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn36" id="page-chapter-11-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The congregation reportedly tried to persuade the two
                  brothers, whose father had been a Catholic, not to leave the
                  church, offering to double their allowance as catechists.
                  Unpersuaded, the letter suggests they were ‘treated with great
                  contempt and abuse’, and given a kicking, which was ‘received
                  as became the disciples of the meek and lowly Jesus’, praying
                  for their attackers. The younger brother was accused by the
                  crowd of saying they were the “Antichrist”, to which he
                  replied that beating and flogging the pair received ‘fully
                  proved that <em>they</em> deserved that name.’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn37" id="page-chapter-11-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The brothers then went to the Catholic Church ‘with a view to
                  removing some images which were their private property, and
                  which had formerly belonged to their father’, destroying all
                  except that of the Virgin Mary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This had been embellished with jewels by ‘infatuated
                  devotees’, especially one woman who believed Mary ‘had been
                  propitious to her’. The congregation claimed the jewels as the
                  property of the church, attempting to persuade the brothers to
                  accept payment for statue, arguing that ‘if it were taken
                  away, some curse would descend upon the congregation’ – some
                  of the details of their offers were summarised in the
                  paragraph that was quoted in the catalogue of the Missionary
                  Museum.

                    that they did not refuse their offers because the expected
                    more money for it; but being aware of the danger of making
                    it an object of worship, they felt, as the disciples of
                    Christ, constrained to take it away</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn38" id="page-chapter-11-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>

                  When they did so they were charged with further debts which
                  were subsequently dismissed by a magistrate. Baptised by
                  Samuel Flavel, they took the names Nathaniel<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn39" id="page-chapter-11-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>

                  taking the statue of the Virgin Mary and infant Jesus with
                  them.

                  According to the letter signed by the three European

                  Here, at last, was an ‘idol’ unambiguously ‘given up by former
                  worshippers, from a full conviction of the folly and sin of
                  idolatry’ in the East Indies section of the catalogue of the
                  Missionary Museum. Rather than being a Hindu <em>murti</em> or
                  Buddharūpa, however, it was an image of the Virgin Mary. It
                  may have been given up through ‘a conviction derived from the
                  ministry of the Gospel by the Missionaries’ although these
                  Missionaries were not Europeans, but fairly recent Indian
                  converts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following month, in February 1826, the editors of the
                  <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> returned to the Bangalore
                  mission, printing another letter from the same three
                  missionaries sent slightly earlier, on 15 May 1825. This
                  described an encounter between Samuel Flavel and an Indian
                  Catholic from Madras. Evidently ‘all that Samuel said was well
                  received, till he spoke against praying to the Virgin Mary and
                  departed saints’. The two men agreed to have a public
                  disputation in the bazar, for which Samuel proposed four
                  questions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Is the faith of the Roman Catholic church the faith of the
                    church of Christ?
                  </li>
                  <li>Is the church of Rome the church of Christ?</li>
                  <li>
                    Are its ceremonies, – such as bowing to the priests with
                    their faces to the ground, counting their beads, and wearing
                    crosses round their necks, the ceremonies of the church of
                    Christ?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Are its acts of worship,- such as bowing to images, ringing
                    of bells, &amp;c. – lawful in the church of Christ?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn41" id="page-chapter-11-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Their conversations were evidently attended by sixty or
                  seventy people, many of whom are referred to as ‘heathens’,
                  and their meetings continued over more than a fortnight.
                  According to the letter, the seriousness with which these
                  events were approached made the European missionaries at
                  Bangalore think:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>of the contests which, in the days of Luther and of Calvin,
                    produced such effects in the western world; and we rejoiced
                    in the hope that this might prove a commencement of the more
                    certain and speedy overthrow of Antichrist in this distant
                    land</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn42" id="page-chapter-11-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>

                <p>
                  In the translation and summary of the dialogue that was
                  printed, the disputation centred on the accuracy of the
                  translation of the second commandment, relating to graven
                  images, with Flavel exclaiming that:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>I believe, then, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; that
                    he is the only Mediator between God and Man; that he is the
                    way, the truth, and the life; that he is able to save to the
                    uttermost all that come unto God by him; and that he is the
                    only Advocate who intercedes for us at the right hand of his
                    Father</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn43" id="page-chapter-11-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When challenged on the difference between worshiping and
                  looking at images, Flavel’s Catholic interlocutor suggested
                  that Protestant bibles also included pictures of Jesus Christ.
                  Flavel’s counter was to volunteer to burn these images and say
                  he rejected them if his interlocutor was prepared to do the
                  same for Catholic images.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The letter ends its account of the dialogue by stating that it
                  was an imperfect translation ‘as Samuel speaks his own
                  language not only very correctly, but often with elegance and
                  eloquence’ – revealing the severe linguistic limitations that
                  held back the preaching efforts of European missionaries in
                  other parts of the world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-chapter-11-fn44" id="page-chapter-11-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is significant that both letters sent from Bangalore in
                  1825 end by outlining plans for Mysore College, a seminary
                  that was intended to bring ‘forward pious native youth for the

                  support and embrace local Christian teachers, such as Samuel
                  Flavel, would become a defining question for the Directors of

                  grateful to Tobias Delfs for the invitation to contribute to

                  As someone who is not a specialist on South Asia, I have been
                  cautious venturing into this field, but in writing these
                  artefactual histories I realised I had probably learnt more
                  from tutorials in Oxford with Nicholas Allen and Clare Harris,
                  as well as lectures by Richard Gombrich, than I had
                  remembered. I am grateful for my education in South Asian
                  religion and would like to mark Nick’s passing in 2020.

                      THE articles which compose this Museum were supplied<br>
                      chiefly by the Missionaries employed by the London Mis¬<br>
                      sionary Society; a few others are donations from
                      benevo¬<br>
                      lent travellers, or friendly officers of mercantile
                      vessels. The<br>
                      Missionaries rightly judged that the natural productions
                      of<br>
                      the distant countries in which they reside would be
                      accept¬<br>
                      able at home, especially to their juvenile friends, and
                      to<br>
                      others who may not have opportunity of viewing larger
                      Col¬<br>
                      lections. The efforts also of natural genius, especially
                      in<br>
                      countries rude and uncivilized, afford another class of
                      in¬<br>
                      teresting curiosities; whilst they prove how capable
                      even<br>
                      the most uncivilized of mankind are of receiving that
                      in¬<br>
                      struction which it is the study of the Missionaries to
                      com¬<br>
                      municate.<br>
                      But the most valuable and impressive objects in this
                      Col¬<br>
                      lection are the numerous, and (in some instances)
                      horrible,<br>
                      IDOLS, which have been imported from the South Sea<br>
                      Islands, from India, China, and Africa; and among
                      these,<br>
                      those especially which were actually given up by their
                      former<br>
                      worshippers, from a full conviction of the folly and sin
                      of<br>
                      idolatry—a conviction derived from the ministry of the
                      Gos¬<br>

                      singularly interesting objects, comply with the wish of
                      the<br>
                      late king of Otaheite, who, when he abandoned the
                      idolatrous<br>
                      and cruel religion of his fathers, requested the
                      Missionaries<br>
                      either to consume these idols in the fire, or “ send them
                      to<br>
                      Britain, that the English people might see what foolish
                      gods<br>
                      they had been accustomed to adore.’<br>
                      It is hoped that a view of these “ trophies of
                      Christianity<br>
                      will inspire the spectators with gratitude to God for his
                      great<br>
                      goodness to our native land, in favouring us so
                      abundantly<br>
                      with the means of grace, and the knowledge of his
                      salvation;<br>
                      and at the same time, with thankfulness that these
                      blessings<br>
                      have, in some happy degree, been communicated, and by

                        THE ZEBRA, or WILD Ass;<br>
                        With a short erect mane; the head and body striped
                        with<br>
                        brown lines downwards; the legs and thighs crossways;<br>
                        tail like that of an ass size of a common mule.<br>
                        This elegant quadruped inhabits the plains of Africa ;
                        but<br>
                        on the sight of man runs into the woods and
                        disappears.<br>
                        Zebras are gregarious and very swift, but being
                        vicious<br>
                        and untameable, are useless to man.<br>
                        Possibly this may be the Wild Ass mentioned in the
                        book<br>
                        of Job, chap. xxxix. 5—8.<br>
                        « Who hath sent forth the wild-ass at large?<br>
                        « And the reins of the wild mule who hath loosed?<br>
                        *Whose house I have ma de the wilderness,<br>
                        « And his house the salt waste.<br>
                        « He mocketh at the uproar of the city,<br>
                        «And the jargon of the driver he heedeth not ;<br>
                        He traverseth the mountains, his pasturage;<br>

                        specimen in England.<br>
                        In its general appearance it has the resemblance of
                        the<br>
                        Gnoo, but is of a larger size; tail long and black,

                        shoulders, and continuing to the middle of the back;<br>
                        forehead like that of the Buffalo, covered with an
                        osseous<br>
                        excrescence, being in fact the root of the horns,

                      in diameter, naked, and apparently glandulous; a long<br>
                      black beard like the Gnoo, covering the throat from the<br>
                      chin to the breast ; the nose and mouth somewhat like<br>

                      Barrow’s Truvels, p. 37.<br>
                      This is a very rare animal; was shot on the banks of
                      the<br>
                      Malalareen river, in the Boschuana country, by Mr.
                      Camp¬<br>
                      bell’s party, July, 1813.<br>
                      3. The CAPE ANT-EATER,<br>
                      Snout long; ears large; tail tapering to the tip :
                      inhabits<br>
                      the Cape of Good Hope; nearly the size of the Hog;<br>
                      burrows in the ground; sleeps by day, and prowls by<br>
                      night; his muscular strength is so great, that it is
                      scarcely<br>
                      possible to drag him out of his hole when wounded.<br>
                      The food of this animal consists principally of Ants.
                      On<br>
                      arriving at an ant-hill he scratches it up with his
                      claws,<br>
                      and then unfolds his slender tongue, covered with a<br>
                      clammy matter or saliva, in which the Ants become en¬<br>
                      tangled in great numbers ; the tongue is then drawn
                      back<br>
                      into his mouth, and he swallows thousands of them
                      alive.<br>
                      4. The CASSOWARY,<br>
                      Three-toed; inhabits the torrid zone in Asia; feeds on<br>
                      vegetables; is, like the Ostrich, unable to fly, but
                      runs<br>
                      with great swiftness when aided by its wings; is very<br>
                      fierce, and grunts like a swine. The eggs, two of which<br>
                      accompany the bird, are greenish, with deeper spots of<br>
                      the same colour.<br>
                      Over Case A.<br>
                      THREE LARGE DISHES, cut out of the solid wood,<br>
                      and used by the natives of Otaheite at their meals,

                        Dr. John Mason Good, on the Book of Job, has the
                        following note on this<br>
                        passage.<br>
                        66<br>
                        Rhinoceros. In the original (reem); by all the older
                        trans¬<br>
                        lators rendered Rhinoceros or Unicorn; but by some
                        modern writers, Bubalus,<br>
                        Bison, or Wild-Ox. There can be no doubt that Rhinoceros
                        (the one-horned)<br>
                        is the proper term ; for this animal is universally
                        known in Arabia, by the name<br>
                        Reem, to the present day.— With regard to the animal
                        called by our Heralds<br>
                        the Unicorn, and represented in armorial bearings, I
                        doubt if ever such an<br>
                        animal existed. The Reem is also called Huadee, which
                        signifies the beast of<br>
                        one horn; Aouda signifies a Mare; hence, perhaps, by an
                        easy corruption of<br>
                        names; the Aouda has been mistaken for Huaddee, and the
                        figure of a horse<br>
                        with a horn has been adopted as the figure of the Reem,

                      AISSIONARY MUSEUM.<br>
                      This huge animal was shot by Mr. Campbell’s party in
                      the<br>
                      kingdom of MASHow, South Africa, May 19, 1820, about<br>
                      1,200 miles northof the Cape ; the body was too
                      unwieldy<br>
                      for carriage to Cape Town. The horn is three feet in<br>
                      length; behind it is a thick horny substance,
                      apparently<br>
                      designed to support it. The head measured three feet<br>
                      from the mouth to the ear, and was much larger than<br>
                      another Rhinoceros with the crooked horn (now placed<br>
                      next to it). The smaller animal, shot at the same time,<br>
                      measured eleven feet in length ; this, therefore, must
                      have<br>
                      been much larger, and so formidable, that no known<br>
                      animal is able to cope with it. The horn is solid, and
                      the<br>
                      natives make handles for their battle axes from it.<br>
                      This specimen excited great curiosity when Mr. Campbell<br>
                      returned to Cape Town, and at St. Helena. Since it was<br>
                      placed in our Museum, a drawing of it has been made,<br>
                      and an Essay written by a gentleman ofthe Royal
                      Society,<br>
                      inserted in the Transactions of that Institution.*<br>

                      Shot in the Mashow Country, South Africa, by Mr. Camp-<br>
                      bell’s party, May 1820.<br>
                      3. LOWER JAW of the HIPPOPOTAMUS, or RIVER<br>
                      HORSE,<br>
                      Amphibious: inhabits rivers of Africa; gregarious;
                      wanders<br>
                      a few miles from the water; feeds by night on
                      vegetables<br>
                      and roots of trees; walks slowły and heavily; swims<br>
                      dexterously, and walks under water, but cannot remain<br>
                      long without rising to the surface to take breath;
                      nearly<br>
                      as large as the elephant ; the teeth very white, and
                      harder<br>
                      In the paper above referred to, read by Sir Everard Home,
                      Bart. F.R.S.<br>
                      to the Royal Society, Dec. 13, 1821, that gentleman shows
                      that a new species<br>
                      of Rhinoceros, found in the interior of Africa, bears a
                      close resemblance to that<br>
                      found in a fossil state in Siberia; of which, together
                      with that before us, there<br>
                      is an accurate engraving. In the conclusion of this paper,
                      the writer says,<br>
                      The account in the Bible of an Unicorn not to be tamed,
                      mentioned by Job,<br>
                      bears so great an affinity to this animal, that there is
                      much reason to believe<br>
                      that it is the same.

                      The GIRAFFE, or CAMELOPARDALIS.<br>
                      Shot in the Griqua Country, South Africa, by Mr.
                      Campbell’s<br>
                      party, July 31, 1814.<br>
                      This very peculiar animal inhabits the interior parts
                      of<br>
                      Africa, and the forests of Ethiopia. It is remarkable
                      for<br>
                      the great disproportion of height between the fore and<br>
                      hind parts. The head is like that of a Stag ; the neck
                      is<br>
                      slender; the tail long, with strong hairs at the end;
                      the<br>
                      whole is of a dirty white, marked with large broad
                      rusty<br>
                      spots. It is very timid, but not swift; it runs
                      awkwardly,<br>
                      and is casily taken. It browses on trees, yet can feed
                      on<br>
                      the grass, and drinks water from the brook. Its height<br>
                      is from fifteen to seventeen feet, but some have been
                      seen<br>
                      more than twenty feet. This specimen is about sixteen<br>
                      feet.<br>
                      The Giraffe was known to the Romans in early times. It<br>
                      appears among the figures in the assemblage of castern<br>
                      animals in the celebrated Prænestine Pavement, made by<br>
                      the direction of Sylla, and is represented both grazing<br>
                      and browsing, in its natural attitudes. It was
                      exhibited<br>
                      at Rome by the popular Casar, among other animals, in<br>
                      the Circæan Games.<br>

                      MISSKONARY MUSEUM.<br>
                      For many years they appeared to labour almost in vain;
                      yet<br>
                      there was reason to believe that a few individuals,
                      feeling<br>
                      in their last moments the need of that salvation which<br>
                      they had too long neglected, cast their dying eyes even<br>
                      to the cross, and expired in hope of eternal life by
                      Jesus<br>
                      Christ. The Missionaries, with exemplary patience, per¬<br>
                      severed in their labours for nearly fifteen years, when<br>
                      they were driven from Otaheite by a civil war, and
                      nearly<br>
                      abandoned the work as hopeless; but, on the restoration<br>
                      of peace, they gladly returned, at the request of King<br>
                      Pomare, and with pleasure renewed their labours.<br>
                      On the 18th of July, 1812, Pomare, who had always be-<br>
                      haved in a friendly manner to the Missionaries,
                      declared<br>
                      his full conviction of the truth of the Gospel, as the
                      result<br>
                      of deliberate consideration—his determination to
                      worship<br>
                      Jéhovah as the only living and true God—and his desire<br>
                      to make a public profession of his faith, by being bap¬<br>
                      tized.<br>
                      His example was soon followed by the principal chiefs
                      and<br>
                      their people, who, being convinced of idolatry, burnt
                      their<br>
                      idols, destroyed their maraes (sacred places),
                      abandoned<br>
                      human sacrifices and infant murders, forsook their
                      abomi¬<br>
                      nable impurities, and strictly observed the Lord’s day.<br>
                      Pomare, in a letter to the Missionaries, dated Feb. 19,
                      1816,<br>
                      when he sent his domestic idols to them, (those which<br>
                      now appear in the central part of Case F, in the
                      Museum)<br>
                      says, “ I wish you to send those idols to Britane, for
                      the<br>
                      Missionary Society, that they may know the likeness of<br>
                      the gods that Tahiti worshipped. Those were my own<br>
                      idols, belonging to our family from the time of Taaroa¬<br>
                      manhahune* even to Viaratoa.” The principal idol<br>
                      that has red feathers is TEMEHaRo; that was Viaratod<br>
                      own god; it was he who put them about the idol. If you<br>
                      think proper, you may burn them all in the fire ; or,
                      if<br>
                      you like, send them to your country, for the inspection
                      of¬<br>
                      the people of Europe, that they may satisfy their
                      curiosity,<br>
                      and know Tahiti’s foolish god!<br>
                      Great additions have since been made to the number of
                      idois<br>
                      now in the Museum, from other islands, which have em¬<br>
                      braced Christianity. The number of such islands is now<br>
                      about Twenty. The number of Churches, some of which<br>
                      Who lived some ages before.<br>
                      One of the names of Pomare’s father—a xealous 'advocate
                      for the gods.

                      24<br>
                      7. SHIVU LINGU, the Destroyer, has three Eyes, rides<br>
                      on a Bull, his Eyes inflamed with intoxicating herbs;<br>
                      he bears a strong resemblance to Bacchus.<br>
                      8. RADHA, Mistress of Krishnu, a deified Adultress.<br>
                      9. VISHNOO, a Black Man, with four Arms, wears yellow<br>
                      garments : is reputed to have nine incarnations, a<br>
                      tenth is expected ; he is sometimes the household god,<br>
                      and many choose him for their guardian deity.<br>
                      See the picture on the left hand wall, sent from
                      Travancore.<br>
                      10. VISWAKARMA, a Monkey God, who assisted Hunoo-<br>
                      manu (see No. 14.) in building a bridge.<br>
                      1I. GUNESHU, in the form of a fat short man, with an<br>
                      Elephant’s head.<br>
                      He is styled the son of Doorga, and it is said that
                      when<br>
                      Shunee and the rest of the gods went to see the child,<br>
                      Shunee (Saturn), knowing that if he turned his eyes
                      upon<br>
                      it, it would be reduced to ashes, refused to look at
                      it,<br>
                      which the mother resented as an insult. For some time<br>
                      he disregarded her reproofs, but at length, being
                      irritated,<br>
                      he looked upon Gunesheu, and his head was instantly<br>
                      consumed. The goddess, seeing her child headless, was<br>
                      overwhelmed with grief, and would have destroyed<br>
                      Shunee, but Brumha prevented her, telling Shunee to<br>
                      bring the head of the first animal she could find,
                      which<br>
                      happened to be an elephant; he cut off his head, and<br>
                      fixed it on Guneshu’s shoulders.<br>
                      Doorga was but little soothed when she saw her son with<br>
                      an elephant’s head ; but Brumha, to pacify her, said,
                      that<br>
                      amongst the worship of all the gods, that of Guneshu<br>
                      should ever have the preference. He is not only
                      honoured<br>
                      in all religious coremonies, but in almost every civil
                      con¬<br>
                      cern. When a person is leaving his house to go a
                      journey,<br>
                      he says, thou work-perfecting Guneshu, grant me<br>
                      success in my journey?’ at the head of every letter à<br>
                      salutation is made to Guneshu; when a person begins to<br>
                      read a book, he salutes Guneshu, and shopkéepers paint<br>
                      his name or image over their shops, expecting from his<br>
                      favour protection and success.

                      25<br>
                      12. SEETA, one of the terrestrial goddesses.<br>
                      She is represented as a yellow woman, covered with
                      jewels;<br>
                      she was the daughter of king Junuka. She was carried<br>
                      away by the giant Ravunu, which occasioned a long war;<br>
                      Ravunu was at length killed, which occasioned such joy,<br>
                      that the gods, Ramu, the monkeys, and the bears, all<br>
                      began to dance. She became the wife of Ramu, together<br>
                      with whom she is worshipped.<br>
                      13. JUGUNNATHU.<br>
                      This is a deified hero, whose name signifies “ Lord of
                      the<br>
                      world," he is a form of Vishnoo. The image of this
                      god<br>
                      has no legs, and only stumps of arms; the heads and
                      eyes<br>
                      are large. Krishnu, it seems, had accidentally been
                      killed<br>
                      by a hunter, who left his body to rot under a tree; his<br>
                      bones, however, were collected, and kept in a box, till
                      a<br>
                      pious king was directed by Vishnoo to form the image of<br>
                      Jugunnathu, and put into its belly these bones. Vishwu¬<br>
                      kurmu, the architect of the gods, undertook to make the<br>
                      image; but declared, that if disturbed while he was<br>
                      about it, he would leave it unfinished. The king who<br>
                      employed him, being impatient to see the image, went to<br>
                      the spot, when the artist desisted from the work, and<br>
                      left the god without hands or feet. The king was much<br>
                      discouraged, but on praying to Brumha, he promised to<br>
                      make the image famous in its present shape. Beumha<br>
                      himself gave eyes and a soul to it. He has many
                      temples;<br>
                      one of the most famous is in Orissa.<br>
                      The annual Car Festival is the most popular; the car is
                      in<br>
                      form of a tapering tower, between fifty and sixty feet<br>
                      in height: it has sixteen wheels, two horses, and a
                      coach¬<br>
                      man, all of wood. The crowd draw the carriage by<br>
                      means of a hawser; he is supposed to pay an annual
                      visit<br>
                      to his brother; and while the car remains empty near
                      his<br>
                      brother’s temple, immense crowds flock to gaze at the<br>
                      indecent pictures which are painted on it. At the end<br>
                      of eight days he is drawn back again to his own temple.<br>
                      Unnumbered multitudes of pilgrims, from all parts of
                      India,<br>
                      attend this festival, among whom a great mortality fre¬<br>
                      quently prevails; and hundreds, perhaps thousands of<br>
                      persons, diseased or distressed, have cast themselves
                      un-<br>
                      der the wheels of this ponderous car, and been crushed<br>
                      to death.

                      26<br>
                      14. HUNOOMANU, the Monkey God.<br>
                      Has a place among the gods, as a form of Shiva ; temples
                      to<br>
                      his honour are seen, and in some places his image is
                      wor¬<br>
                      shipped daily ; he is even chosen by many as their
                      guar¬<br>
                      dian deity. He bears some resemblance to Pan.<br>
                      Hunoomanu is represented as having done wonders in the<br>
                      battles of Ramu, particularly his leaping across the
                      sea<br>
                      (500 miles) when employed as a spy, and forming a<br>
                      bridge across another sea by throwing mountains into
                      it.<br>
                      He had the misfortune, however, at one time, to be
                      taken<br>
                      and carried before Ravunu, the king, who ordered his<br>
                      tail to be set on fire ; when, leaping from house to
                      house<br>
                      he burnt the city of Lunka, where the king resided :
                      not<br>
                      being able to extinguish the fire on his tail, he was<br>
                      directed by Seeta to spit upon it, and he, raising his
                      tail<br>
                      to his face for that purpose, set his face on fire. He
                      then<br>
                      complained, that when he arrived at home with such a<br>
                      black face, all the other monkeys would laugh at him.<br>
                      Seeta, to comfort him, assured him that all the other<br>
                      monkeys should have black faces also, which on his
                      return<br>
                      home he found to be the case.<br>
                      The following is a form of prayer to this monkey-god :<br>
                      O! Hunoomanu! when I go eastward, do thou preserve<br>
                      me! O!son of Puvunu! when I proceed southward, do<br>
                      thou keep me! O! beloved son of Keshuree! when I go<br>
                      westward, do thou preserve me! O! Kamungu! keep<br>
                      me from danger when I go northward !? &amp;c.<br>
                      15. RAMU.<br>
                      A deified monarch, the hero of a famous Hindoo poem
                      called<br>
                      the Ramayunn (translated into English by the Serampore<br>
                      Missionaries). He is adored as the seventh Hindoo in¬<br>
                      carnation. In one of his battles he destroyed fourteen<br>
                      thousand giants. He had an army of monkeys, of which<br>
                      Hunoomanu was general. Ramu, with their assistance,<br>
                      tore up mountains, and by throwing them into the sea,<br>
                      formed a bridge. Ramu cut off the ten heads of his<br>
                      enemy Ravunu, a hundred times, but they were always<br>
                      miraculously restored; he was however slain at last.<br>
                      On the birth-day of this god, the Hindoo merchants
                      begin<br>
                      their new-year’s accounts. Many Hindoos write his name<br>
                      on the breast and forchead of a dying person, in con¬<br>
                      sequence of which they believe that instead of being

                      dragged to judgment, he ascends immediately to heaven.<br>
                      The mark on the forehead of his followers resembles a<br>
                      trident.<br>
                      16. BULURAMU, painted white, cotemporary with Krish-<br>
                      nu; his image always accompanies that of Juggernaut.<br>
                      17. SHIIVU, the DESTROYER.<br>
                      He is represented in a variety of forms, one of which is
                      a<br>
                      bloated image, resembling that of Bacchus. He has a
                      thou¬<br>
                      sand names. He is daily worshipped, chiefly under the<br>
                      form of Linga, which is to be found in innumerable tem¬<br>
                      ples; the worshippers of this image are far more nume¬<br>
                      rous than the worshippers of all the other gods put<br>
                      together.<br>
                      It is at the annual festival of this deity that certain
                      devotees<br>
                      pierce their tongues, bore their sides, swing by hooks<br>
                      fastened in their backs, and perform many other horrid<br>
                      ceremonies of self-torture.<br>
                      18. KRISHNU.<br>
                      Krishnu is one of the terrestrial gods, and said to be one
                      of<br>
                      the ten incarnations of Vishnoo : his image is that of
                      a<br>
                      black man, with a flute in his hand. He is the Hindoo<br>
                      Apollo. Wonderful stories are recorded of his achieve¬<br>
                      ments: when a sucking infant he destroyed a giant; at<br>
                      eight years of age he took up a mountain, and held it
                      as<br>
                      an umbrella over some villagers and their cattle, during
                      a<br>
                      dreadful storm ; he destroyed a terrible serpent or
                      hydra;<br>
                      he created a number of cattle, and also of boys and
                      girls.<br>
                      The images of this lascivious and blood-stained hero
                      are<br>
                      worshipped by a great proportion of the Hindoo popula-<br>
                      tion, with an enthusiasm which transforms them into the<br>
                      very likeness of himself. Several festivals are held in<br>
                      honour of Krishnu, some of which are in the night, ac¬<br>
                      companied with the most abominable practices. Krishnu’s<br>
                      thefts, wars, and adulteries, are so numerous, that his<br>
                      whole history seems to be one uninterrupted series of<br>
                      crimes.<br>

                      holy books, are said to proceed from his four mouths.

                      20. GUNGA, or the River GANGES.<br>
                      The Hindoos not only reverence their rivers, but
                      actually<br>
                      worship them. The most extravagant things are related<br>
                      respecting the purifying water of this river ; it is
                      carried<br>
                      in vessels to immense distances —every thing it touches<br>
                      becomes pure ; crowds of Hindoos perform their worship<br>
                      on the banks of the Ganges, and the sick are laid
                      there,<br>
                      expecting recovery from the sight of this goddess, and
                      it<br>
                      is reckoned a great calamity not to die in view of
                      Gunga.<br>
                      Some persons even drown themselves in the Ganges, not<br>
                      doubting but they shall immediately ascend to heaven.<br>
                      21. LUKSHMEE, a Goddess, one of the wives of Vishnoo,<br>
                      who is continually quarrelling with SURUSWUTTEE,<br>
                      his other wife.<br>
                      The former is the goddess of Prosperity ; the latter
                      the<br>
                      goddess of Learning.<br>
                      One of their poets says, that the troubles of Vishnoo’s<br>
                      family have turned him into wood. And all the Hindoos<br>
                      admit that it is a great misfortune for a man to have
                      two<br>
                      wives, especially if they dwell in the same house.<br>

                        portion<br>
                        of his divine nature.<br>
                        « Once upon a time the illustrious Amare Deva (d),
                        reno¬<br>
                        vated amongst men, coming here, discovered the place
                        of<br>
                        the supreme being in the great forest. One night he
                        had<br>
                        a vision, and heard a voice saying, Name whatever
                        boon<br>
                        thou wantest. Amare Deva astonished, with due reve¬<br>
                        rence replied, First give me a visitation, and then
                        grant me<br>
                        such a boon. He had another dream, and the voice
                        said,<br>
                        How can there be an apparition in the Kali yüg? The<br>
                        same reward may be obtained from the sight of an
                        image,<br>
                        or from the worship of an image, as from the
                        immediate<br>
                        visitation of a deity. Having heard this, he caused
                        an<br>
                        image of the supreme spirit, Buddha, to be made; and
                        he<br>
                        worshipped it according to the law, with perfumes,
                        in¬<br>
                        censes, and the like ; and he thus glorified the name
                        of<br>
                        that supreme being, the incarnation of a portion of

                      31<br>
                      In the front of the larger idols are several smaller ones,
                      of<br>
                      silver, brass, copper, and stone : also a curious censer,
                      or<br>
                      spoon, for incense.<br>
                      These are specimens, Christian Reader, of the gods of the
                      hea¬<br>
                      then in India, worshipped by more than a hundred
                      millions<br>
                      of deluded people. These are the creatures of a corrupt<br>
                      imagination, and the workmanship of men’s hands they<br>
                      have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but
                      they<br>
                      see not ; they have ears, but they hear not; they have
                      hands,<br>
                      but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not;<br>
                      neither speak they through their throat. They that make<br>
                      them are like unte them; so is every one that trusteth
                      in<br>
                      them. O Israel, trust thou in the Lord. Psalm cXv.
                      5—10.<br>
                      Nine-tenths of the whole Hindoo population pay no con¬<br>
                      scientious regard whatever to the forms of their
                      religion,<br>
                      and yet the various cruelties accompanying their super¬<br>
                      stitions occasion the death of more than ten thousand<br>
                      persons every year. And notwithstanding the veneration<br>
                      in which some pretend to hold their gods, yet many,<br>
                      especially of the poor, take the liberty of abusing
                      them.<br>
                      When it thunders awfully, respectable Hindoos say,<br>
                      « Oh! the gods are giving us a bad day ;” the lower<br>
                      orders say, “ The rascally gods are dying.” During a<br>
                      heavy rain, a woman of respectable class frequently
                      says,<br>
                      « Let the gods perish! my clothes are all wet.” A man<br>
                      of low caste says, “ These rascally gods are sending
                      more<br>
                      rain."<br>

                      longed to two Native Roman Catholics, who em¬<br>
                      braced the Christian religion, andsent the same to the<br>
                      Missionary Society.<br>
                      « The people were in great consternation at the removal
                      of<br>
                      the image, and offered large sums of money for it ; one<br>
                      offered twenty pagodas, another his daughter, and
                      another<br>
                      even declared he would sell his own child and procure<br>
                      money enough to purchase it, if it might be retained;
                      but<br>
                      a deaf car was turned to the proposals, being aware of<br>
                      the danger of making it an object of worship, and felt
                      as<br>
                      the disciples of Christ,constrained to take it away.’<br>

                      was taken off by the ship Queen Charlotte of Sydnev.<br>

                      might be noticed as a civilized person, and not a
                      savage,<br>

                        hollow part of the Elephant’s tusks; the use of the saw
                        is<br>
                        unknown; they have discovered a method of softening<br>
                        the ivory, by letting it lie for some days in sour milk,
                        by<br>
                        which it becomes so soft, that it may be cut with a<br>
                        knife.” One of the copper rings is for the neck :
                        some<br>

                      40<br>
                      12. A RAZOR from Mashow, from South Africa.<br>
                      13. A SHAVING BRUSH, made of wood, by beating it<br>
                      when green ; used by the Corannas.<br>
                      14. Four KURRECHANE KNIVES.<br>
                      15. NEEDLES, used by the Bootchuanas and Morolongs.<br>
                      16. The FOOT of a small ANTELOPE.<br>
                      17. On the Wall, A COPPER EAR-RING, worn by the<br>
                      Men at Lattakoo; weighs two ounces and a half.<br>
                      18. A LATTAKOO SNUFF-BOX of Leather.<br>
                      19. BRANCHES of the STOP-A-WHILE, a singular<br>
                      Thorn.<br>
                      The bushes were uncommonly troublesome, especially<br>
                      that called Stop-a-while, tearing the oxen, waggons and<br>
                      our clothes. I was so completely laid hold of by one<br>
                      bush, that with much difficulty I got extricated; for
                      no<br>
                      sooner had I got disengaged from one hook, than I found<br>
                      two or three others had got hold of my clothes; or when<br>
                      breaking the twig by which I was detained, another<br>
                      caught the arm that broke it."—Campbell’s Travels,<br>
                      p. 336.<br>
                      20. The HAIR from the TAIL of the CAMELOPARD.<br>
                      21. The BARK of a TREE, used by the natives as Paper,<br>
                      and for Boxes.<br>
                      22. ORNAMENTS made of Shells, cut in rings.<br>
                      23. PEAS DRIED, used as a Necklace.<br>
                      24. A NECKLACE of Beans.<br>
                      25. A Ditto of Peas.

                      26. A Ditto, made of Composition.<br>
                      27. The MANTIS, or WALKING LEAF,<br>
                      In Zoology, is a genus of insects belonging to the order
                      of<br>
                      Hemiptera; of this genus there is a great variety of
                      species,<br>
                      called by different names, of which the Mantis Fausta,<br>
                      and the Orator Mantis, or Mantis Precaria, are chiefly<br>
                      noticed. Their general characters are these :—the head<br>
                      is unsteady, being but slightly attached to the thorax.<br>
                      which is very long. The mouth is armed with jaws, and<br>
                      has its feelers filiform. The wings are four, membrana¬<br>
                      ceous and convolute ; the under ones plaited or folded.<br>
                      The fore legs are compressed, armed on the under side<br>
                      with teeth like a saw, and terminated by a single claw.<br>
                      The hind legs are smooth, and formed, in some of the<br>
                      species, rather for moving slowly than for leaping.
                      This<br>
                      is thought to be one of the most singular genera in the<br>
                      whole class of insects, and the imagination can hardly<br>
                      conceive shapes more strange than those exhibited by<br>
                      some particular species.<br>
                      But the most extraordinary circumstance relative to
                      this<br>
                      insect, is the general veneration in which it is held
                      among<br>
                      uncivilized or superstitious people, so that it has
                      obtained<br>
                      the name Mantis, a Greek word signifying a Prophet, or<br>
                      Soothsayer, for it was imagined that this insect, when<br>
                      resting on its hinder legs, and stretching out its two
                      fore<br>
                      feet, divined, and pointed out to enquirers the way
                      they<br>
                      should take when at a loss; or, when joining together
                      its<br>
                      fore feet, and holding them up, it was engaged in
                      prayer;<br>
                      hence the common people in Languedoc, (a province of<br>
                      France,) where it is very common, call it Le Prie Dieu-<br>
                      as if it prayed to God; and in allusion to this notion,<br>
                      Linneus gives it the name of Mantis oratoria, the
                      praying<br>
                      Mantis. Dr. Vanderkemp, in his account of Caffraria,<br>
                      describing this insect, says, “ the Caffres call it
                      Oumtoni¬<br>
                      zoulou, that is, The Child of Heaven. The Hottentots<br>
                      consider it almost as a deity, and offer their prayers to
                      it,<br>
                      begging that it may not destroy them,” &amp;c. Mr.
                      Kicherer,<br>
                      when in England, frequently mentioned this custom ; and<br>
                      in a Narrative which he drew up, says, “ They have no<br>
                      idea whatever of the Supreme Being, consequently they<br>
                      practise no kind of worship : they have, however, a
                      super¬<br>
                      stitious reverence for a little insect, known by the
                      name<br>
                      of The Creeping Leaf, a sight of which, they conceive,<br>
                      indicates something fortunate, and to kill it, they
                      suppose,<br>
                      will bring a curse upon the perpetrator.

                      Asbestos —a native fossil stone, which may be split
                      into<br>
                      threads and filaments, fine and silky. It has the
                      wonder¬<br>
                      ful property of remaining unconsumed in the fire, which<br>
                      only whitens it. The ancients are said to have made<br>
                      paper and napkins of it ; also shrouds for royal
                      funerals,<br>
                      to inclose the corpse on the pile, and preserve the
                      ashes<br>
                      of it from being mingled with those of the wood.<br>
                      Some of these specimens were found by Mr. Campbell in<br>
                      South Africa, where they are very plentiful.

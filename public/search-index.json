One way of understanding the title of Malinowksi’s book is to regard the islanders as early twentieth-century equivalents of the sailors who crewed the <em>Argo</em> of Ancient Greek myth, a ship captained by Jason and protected by the Gods. But <em>Argonauts</em> was not the only book published in 1922 to adopt a classicising title – James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> – a central text in the canon of literary modernism – transposed the voyages and adventures of Odysseus, chronicled in Homer’s Odyssey, onto an ordinary day in Dublin, with Leopold Bloom as its hero.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A worn copy of Ulysses by James Joyce, featuring a blue cover with white lettering, resting on a flat surface.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-3.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ulysses by James Joyce, first edition published in 1922</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A worn copy of Ulysses by James Joyce, featuring a blue cover with white lettering, resting on a flat surface.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-3.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ulysses by James Joyce, first edition published in 1922</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Modernism as an aesthetic and literary movement was consolidated in the years after the First World War – a period in which the world was essentially remade. In 1922, after around 750 years as a centre of English power, Dublin became the capital of the independent Irish Free State.  Old ideas and established authorities were challenged as a new generation of men, Malinowksi and Joyce among them, asserted themselves. If the <em>Argonauts</em> were the Kiriwinans of the Kula ring, then it seems that like Leopold Bloom in <em>Ulysses</em>, Malinowski was the modern(ist) Jason – the legendary hero tasked with bringing back the golden fleece.</p>\n<p>It helps here to know that one of the major works of anthropology before the First World War was <em>The Golden Bough</em> by James Frazer, originally published in two volumes in 1890, three volumes in 1900 and an incredible twelve volumes in the third edition between 1906 and 1915. Frazer’s comparative compendium of mythology developed in relation to the <em>Rex Nemorensis</em>, the priest-king of the sacred grove on the shores of Lake Nemi in Italy.</p>\n<p>In order to become the priest-king, one had to kill the existing priest in combat, after taking the golden bough from one of the trees in the sacred grove. Frazer suggested that the institution of the death and reinstallation of the priest-king was an embodiment of the dying and reviving solar god, central to mythological ideas all over the world – including the death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>\n<p>Malinowski himself had been inspired to become an anthropologist by reading <em>the Golden Bough</em> in three volumes, borrowed from the University of Cracow library:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I realised then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact sister studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Frazer was the reigning priest-king of early twentieth-century British Anthropology, Malinowski’s publication of <em>Argonauts</em> can be read as him presenting his own golden bough. In asking James Frazer to write book’s preface, Malinowski was essentially asking for the inauguration of his own reign – like Jason claiming his rightful place as king following presentation of the golden fleece. Malinowski is remembered for developing the notion of the charter myth, and he certainly deployed the myth of his fieldwork in the Trobriands as a charter from which to establish Social Anthropology as a new approach.</p>\n<p>The Golden Bough_ was also a significant influence on Joyce (as well as T.S. Eliot, who published <em>The Waste Land</em> in 1922), as well as other modernists such as Joseph Conrad. Indeed, Malinowski admired Conrad, a fellow Pole, telling Brenda Seligman that ‘Rivers is the Rider Haggard of Anthropology, I shall be his Conrad!’ (Young 2004, 236). By aligning W.H.R. Rivers (who died in 1922) with Rider Haggard, Malinowski was suggesting he exemplified an imperial tradition of British writing about the non-European ‘other’ which he hoped to overturn in the way Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em> upended romantic Imperial narratives into a denunciation of colonialism, highlighting the ways it dehumanised the Europeans who participated in it.</p>\n<p>Although Malinowski presented his work as inaugurating something of a revolution in Anthropology, his approach was significantly shaped by his engagement with Frazer, providing at the very least an explanation for the title of his book. In the same way that Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em> is structured around the story of a European’s voyage to the interior of the African continent, where he comes to dominate and rule, Malinowski’s account, while ostensibly about the Kula, also emphasises his own heroic role as an ethnographer who gains an understanding of the operation of Kula that is essentially superior to that of those who participate in it. This is an anthropological version of ‘the hero’s journey’ myth – explored by Joseph Campbell’s 1949 book, <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</em> (a major influence on George Lucas’ Star Wars franchise and not unrelated to what Teju Cole, in 2012, called ‘the White-Saviour Industrial complex’).</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A dark, historical image captures a group of individuals seated inside a tent, with figures standing outside amidst tropical vegetation.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-4.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Bronislaw Malinowski in his tent in the Trobriands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A dark, historical image captures a group of individuals seated inside a tent, with figures standing outside amidst tropical vegetation.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-4.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Bronislaw Malinowski in his tent in the Trobriands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A coastal settlement with huts among palm trees, set against a lush jungle backdrop.

It was not uncommon for mid-century Europeans to see themselves as the ones who ‘really’ understood artistic or ceremonial practices in other parts of world. Although twentieth-century Social Anthropology has long been recognised as a modernist form of <em>Writing Culture</em> (Clifford and Marcus 1986), the fact is that <em>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</em> is still widely regarded as an exemplary ethnographic text.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Malinowski’s description of romantically isolated fieldwork remains the standard against which many doctoral anthropology students measure their own efforts, suggesting it has been hard for the discipline to escape the dominating and perhaps domineering influence of the modernists, whose charter myths continue to position them as founding ancestors, or priest-kings in the cult of Social Anthropology.</p>\n<p>For all Malinowksi’s iconoclastic ambitions, the narrative structure of his account betrays a continuity with older European accounts of encounter with other parts of the world. It is striking that central targets for the Modernist generation, from which they sought to distance themselves, perhaps as a result of the what Freud in 1917 called the ‘narcissism of small differences’, were missionaries, but also the museum collections – assembled by anthropological museums during the previous thirty years.</p>\n<p>Modernist anthropologists railed against what they represented as ‘conjectural history’ – the efforts of those who attempted to build frameworks for human history extending beyond the European old world on the basis of facts and artefacts assembled in Europe – an approach increasingly derided as ‘armchair anthropology’. Modernism, and anthropological modernism in particular, was unrelentingly presentist (Fardon 2005). The aim was to explain the operation of society by reference to its contemporary features and characteristics, in the way an anatomist might explain the function of different organs of the body without reference to their evolutionary history.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Cover of Trobriand Cricket.

His access to the field, like that of many anthropologists of his generation was made substantially possible by established networks of Christian missionaries who had operated in Africa and the Pacific for over a century. In the case of the Trobriands, the Methodist missionary M.K. Gilmour had already been stationed at Kiriwina for 14 years when Malinowski arrived in 1915 (Young 1984, 17). Many of Malinowski’s immediate predecessors, the first generation of professional anthropologists, found employment in museums filled by collections assembled in Europe largely through the efforts of previous generations of missionaries.</p>\n<p>In <em>the Right to Look- a counterhistory of visuality</em>, Nicholas Mirzoeff (2011) has suggested that the missionary can be regarded as the metonymic figure of what he called the ‘Imperial Complex of Visuality’, dominant between 1860 and 1945 – as heroes who brought ‘Light into Darkness’ as part of a global “pastorate”. This draws on Michel Foucault’s insight that many of the technologies of governmentality of the modern state were assimilated from forms of Christian pastoral power (Goulder 2007). Thus an enquiry into missionary practice and image making has the potential to illuminate what Talal Asad (2003) has called <em>Formations of the Secular.</em></p>\n<p>Historians such as Boyd Hilton (1988) have demonstrated the significant influence that the 18th century evangelical revival had on British intellectual and cultural forms during the nineteenth century. I would go as far as to suggest that the public museums that took shape in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, as part of what Tony Bennett (1988) has called the ‘exhibitionary complex’, can be regarded as an expansion of the ‘missionary exhibitionary complex’ which developed in evangelical circles earlier in the century. My intention in presenting chronologically ordered chapters is to provide a more detailed insight into the development of these related exhibitionary complexes.</p>\n<p>However, I remain conscious of the textual form I am creating – it would easy to describe a narrative arc from origin, through rise, to decline and fall. But would this simply be an appealing way to shape a story out of the messy details of historical events and sources? A Foucauldian genealogy might trace relationships of descent and alliance, but my intention here is less to construct a genealogy than to provide a gallery of ancestral portraits, which the reader/viewer is encouraged to explore in order to recognise and identify family resemblances.</p>\n<p>Marilyn Strathern (1990) has described the typical approach of modernist anthropology to both artefacts and events as one that makes sense of them in relation to a context. She has contrasted this with what she has called a Melanesian approach to images, whether events or artefacts, as embodying history themselves – they do not need to be “explained” by reference to events outside themselves, but are known by their effects. An image or artefact, when approached as a <em>prestation</em> (or gift) demands reciprocation, so that it comes to be understood through the construction of further artefacts in order to see what their further effects will be, with revelations coming as something of a surprise.</p>\n<p>I would collapse Strathern’s dichotomy between the Melanesian and European approaches (which is itself essentially Modernist) by suggesting that the texts constructed to make sense of things by “Europeans”, by which she essentially means modernist anthropologists (Strathern recognises that museum curators are more like “Melanesians” than her “Europeans”) are artefacts themselves, containing their own contexts. In a world in which the British Library is a distinct institution from the British Museum, we might think of texts as unlike other artefacts, but it is in fact not long since they were part of a single institution (1973). Indeed, most libraries contain artefacts that could happily form part of a museum collection, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>One can read Malinowski’s text as an artefact of a particular type, constructed to evoke a context for the Kula that will allow himself and other Europeans to make sense of it. But typically, the institutions of human life do not come with such manuals. One joins the game of life in the midst of play, and learns the rules by watching and joining in. In Roy Wagner’s (1981) terms, Malinowski, as the ethnographer, “invents” the culture of the Trobriands through the construction of his text(s). Strathern suggests that as part of the modernist approach to Anthropology “it is taken for granted that we study the significance which such artefacts have for the people who make them, and thus their interpretations of them”, but if these assumptions were at least identifiable by 1990, I suggest they should no longer be taken for granted.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Close-up of a decorative textile featuring circular coral and shell beads, strung together with dark thread on a blue fabric base.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-7.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Soulava kula valuable, collected by Bronislaw Malinowski in the Trobriand Islands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">British Museum 20122037.1</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Close-up of a decorative textile featuring circular coral and shell beads, strung together with dark thread on a blue fabric base.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-7.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Soulava kula valuable, collected by Bronislaw Malinowski in the Trobriand Islands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">British Museum 20122037.1</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>A hundred years after the publication of Malinowksi’s <em>Argonauts</em>, I am seeking to revisit the moment of possibility represented by 1922, a return to what Michael North (1999) has called the ‘scene of the modern’. While the COVID19 pandemic has been very different to the First World War, it nevertheless provides a break from business as usual which makes it possible to consider alternative ways of approaching things.</p>\n<p>How best can one write about human life in a way that resists the urge to endlessly contextualise – a tendency to lapse into an essentially theological mode of writing that attempts to elucidate what Malinowski liked to call ‘the native’s point of view’?  Who are /were ‘the natives’ in encounters between missionaries and the people they worked with, and did they really have a single point of view? Is it possible to capture the contingency, uncertainty and provisional nature of much of human life by constructing our accounts differently?</p>\n<p>David Graeber and David Wengrow (2021; 5, 24) have recently challenged us to write history ‘as if it consisted of people one would have been able to talk to, when they were still alive’ as part of an attempt to construct a new science of history that ‘restores our ancestors to their full humanity’. It is to this challenge that I have attempted to respond.</p>\n<p>In his work on the encounters between missionaries and the Yoruba, in what is now Nigeria, J.D.Y. Peel (1995; 2000) drew attention to the centrality of narratives, both in terms of how they structure historical accounts, but also the way in which they were used by participants in these encounters to make sense of their own experiences.</p>\n<p>In response to the work of the Comaroffs (1991, 1997), whose work concentrated on the connections between missionary encounters and the expansion of global capitalism, Peel has suggested that accounts of missionary encounters that do not recognise the centrality of religious narratives runs the risk of reading like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.</p>\n<p>World religions like Christianity, Peel (1995, 9) suggests, are long <em>durée</em> ‘vehicles of trans-historical memory, ceaselessly re-activated in the consciousness of their adherents’. Those engaged in missionary encounters frequently compared and judged their own actions on the basis of biblical precedent, drawing on the complex strands of both the Old and New Testaments to make sense of their own encounters.</p>\n<p>In constructing his own account, Peel worried about ‘how to simplify a complicated and many-stranded story without distorting its essential elements’ (Peel 2000, 44), ultimately arriving at a material metaphor:</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-8\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-8\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Colorful braided rope featuring intertwining red, blue, and green strands, creating a vibrant decorative pattern.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-8.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Three stranded cord</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Colorful braided rope featuring intertwining red, blue, and green strands, creating a vibrant decorative pattern.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-8.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Three stranded cord</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A multi-coloured wooden cord, with component fibres of different lengths – Yoruba, colonial, Christian, and other – that give it structure by pulling both together and against one another.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is striking that in setting out his vision of the history of human thought, Frazer (1911, 307-8) constructed a similar material metaphor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A web of three different threads – the black thread of magic, the red thread of religion, and the white thread of science, if under science we may include those simple truths drawn from the observation of nature…</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Could we survey the web of thought from the beginning, we should probably perceive it to be at first a chequer of black and white… But carry your eye further along the fabric and you will remark that, while the black thread and white chequer still run through it, there rests on the middle portion of the web, where religion has entered most deeply into its texture, a dark crimson stain…</em></p>\n<p>In constructing an artefactual history of the London Missionary Society, my ambition is similarly to construct a narrative out of multiple interlocking strands, coming in and out of conjunction with one another in different ways at different times.</p>\n<p>Textual models range from nineteenth century novels such as George Elliot’s <em>Middlemarch</em> and Herman Melville’s <em>Moby Dick</em> to more recent works such as David Mitchell’s <em>Cloud Atlas,</em> or even Deleuze and Guattari’s <em>A Thousand Plateaus.</em> But in the deeper past we might consider the multi-stranded text of Herodotus’ <em>Histories</em>, or even the books of the Bible itself. In attempting to go beyond what Ann-Laura Stoler (2009) has called ‘familiar stories with predictable plots’, we have a range of textual artefacts to consider as models that do not conform to modernist monomyths – a significant example drawn from twentieth century anthropology would be Gregory Bateson’s (1936) <em>Naven</em>.</p>\n<p>I am not advocating a straightforwardly neo-Frazerian approach, but I do feel that it may be revealing to consider missionary encounters, as well as the way they have been narrated in light of the archetypical story of the priest-king at Nemi. Indeed, I am tempted to regard many of the artefacts collected and brought to Europe as essentially equivalent to Trobriand Kula valuables, but also to the Golden Fleece which Jason returned with to prove his right to rule.</p>\n<p>The widespread adoption of Christianity in large parts of the world over the past two centuries, including Africa and the Pacific in particular, is a transformation of world-historical significance that cannot be accounted for simply by the imposition of European power, or the cultural logic of capitalism – many missionaries were essentially powerless strangers, at least at the point they arrived.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-9\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-9\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Cover of Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, featuring vibrant colors, intricate patterns, traditional motifs, and a rural scene.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-9.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe - cover for first edition, published in 1958</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Cover of Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, featuring vibrant colors, intricate patterns, traditional motifs, and a rural scene.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-9.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe - cover for first edition, published in 1958</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>I take further inspiration from Chinua Achebe’s 1958 <em>Things Fall Apart</em> – an African response to Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em> which recognises the tensions inherent in existing structures of power, and the forms of possibility that the arrival of outsiders missionaries presented for many people. The stranger missionaries did not become priest-kings entirely by their own efforts.</p>\n<p>If the functionalist anthropology of the Modernists concerned itself with how society maintains itself as a functioning system in a steady state or dynamic equilibrium, giving rise to a conception of culture as essentially inherited and determinative, then in a world structured around forms of managerialism intent on maintaining an unsustainable status quo, it has become increasingly urgent to find ways of writing about the mechanisms of societal transformation. How does society renew itself? How does newness enter the world (Bhabha 1994)?</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2><strong>Notes</strong></h2>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Peel, J.

Covering the floor of the observation deck at the UK’s National Maritime Museum, it reduces the globe to something that can be over-seen and over-stepped.</p>\n<p>The museum in which it takes centre stage looks up towards the hill on which the Royal Observatory is perched – home of the Greenwich meridian and zero point for a reckoning of time. Rooted in one location, at the middle of the map, the museum is a ship of time, with deck-like galleries of public display and dark hold-like stores carrying vast cargoes into the future.</p>\n<p>I was there for the gala opening of the museum’s <a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum/attractions/sackler-gallery-pacific-encounters\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Encounters gallery</a>. On a raised platform at the north end of the map, a pair of dancers wearing fibre dance skirts with shells around their necks were performing, accompanied by drummers from <a href=\"https://www.mattersmusical.com/artists/beats-of-polynesia/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Beats of Polynesia</em>,</a> a London based collective whose <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beatspolynesia?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter profile</a> suggests they exist to ‘bring a taste of the Pacific islands to the United Kingdom &amp; Europe’.</p>\n<p>It was 19 September 2018, but their performance recalled other times and other places. In particular, it made me think of a painting, recently hung in a gallery on the other side of the Great Map – <em>The Cession of Matavai</em> – as it is often known. Painted by the English painter Robert Smirke, it commemorates the arrival of the first group of British missionaries at Tahiti in 1797, intent on taking a taste of the UK &amp; Europe, and in particular Protestant Christianity, to the heart of the Pacific.</p>\n<p>But the European perspective that the painting provides was only ever one side of the story – illustrating some of the ways in which Pacific islands and Islanders have been imagined and visualised in Europe over the past 250 years. The new gallery formed part of the Endeavour Galleries project, named for the HMS Endeavour, a British Navy research vessel that left the British Isles in 1768 under the command of Captain James Cook.</p>\n<p>The Endeavour’s main mission had been to observe the passage of Venus across the face of the sun at Tahiti, on the other side of the globe. The story of Cook’s voyages has been so frequently told that it has become part of the myth through which Britain has come to understand itself and its encounters with other parts of the world. The heroic tale of the son of a farm labourer, who through his own ability and hard work rose to command a ship, to literally put Australia on the map, and who in the end was murdered on a beach in Hawai’i, remains hard for us to escape.</p>\n<p>However, in recent years statues to Captain Cook across the Pacific have been a focus for protests about colonialism and its contemporary legacies. On Thursday 1 July 2021, a Cook statue in Victoria on Vancouver Island was torn down and thrown into the harbour by protesters highlighting the ongoing mistreatment of indigenous women and children in contemporary Canada.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>We clearly need to unpack the processes by which white European men were fashioned into the heroes around which so many of the tales of colonial history came to be told. In trying to develop accounts of the past that are recognisable to the descendants of the colonised, as well as the colonisers – as well as those of us whose ancestors came from both sides of what can, at times, feel like an unbreachable historical antagonism – we need to de-centre these historical celebrities within the tales that we tell.</p>\n<p>Disrupting what Ann-Laura Stoler has called familiar stories with predictable plots, our challenge is to find other ways of narrating the histories of encounter between Europe and other parts of the world. As an artefactual history, with its primary focus on the things through which relationships between Europeans and others were mediated, this work is an experimental attempt to respond to this challenge.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks before the gallery opening at Greenwich, I left my job as a curator at the <a href=\"https://maa.cam.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology</a> in Cambridge. The collection there includes a number of historic artefacts collected during Cook’s voyages that remain the celebrities of the collection. Regularly visited by researchers and loaned for exhibition around the world, their carbon footprint was significantly higher than mine in most of the years I worked at the museum, and in the anniversary year of 2018 in particular.</p>\n<p>Greenwich’s Pacific Encounters gallery is framed by Cook’s voyages, showcasing the dramatic oil paintings of William Hodges, a young theatre scene painter who accompanied Cook on his second voyage from 1772 to 1775. Hodges was a romantic who depicted Tahiti as a latter-day Eden in the paintings he completed after his return to London, paid for by the British Admiralty. Hodges made a number of paintings of Matavai Bay and experimented with how to present this landscape – a natural paradise, untouched by European influence, or alternatively a backdrop against which to contrast the sailing vessels, forms of dress and buildings of one island people with that of another.</p>\n<p>While the Cession of Matavai owes something to these paintings of the bay, it depicts events two decades after Hodges had left. I had last seen the painting halfway up the stairs of the library at the University of London’s <a href=\"https://www.soas.ac.uk/library/\" target=\"_blank\">School of Oriental and African Studies</a>, where a number a palm prints suggested it was not quite out of student reach. Five years earlier I was involved in brokering the transfer of the painting, along with a number of other artefacts, across London from the Council for World Mission in Westminster to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.</p>\n<p>Since then, the painting had been professionally conserved, and I had been told that the removal of two hundred years of London grime had revealed previously obscure details. What this painting, alongside other missionary artefacts displayed in the gallery allowed the Maritime Museum to do for the first time, was to tell a story of Pacific Encounters that included Britain’s history of overseas missionary engagements alongside the naval history that had been central to the museum’s purpose since its establishment in 1934.</p>\n<p>No less maritime in nature, missionary history has frequently been told through accounts of ‘heroes’ in the mode of Captain Cook. But it is also a history of encounter that extends far beyond fairly short-lived expeditions of exploration.</p>\n<p>Missionaries generally stayed in the places they were sent for longer periods, and the success of their work – convincing people to convert to Christianity – depended on developing detailed understandings of the lives of the people amongst whom they lived, even if their ultimate intention was to transform these. If the museum was going to tell a story of Britain’s Pacific Encounters, I was pleased it now extended beyond the initial impressions of Captain Cook and William Hodges. But the Cession of Matavai, remains an initial impression.</p>\n<p>With Hodges’ mountains in the background, it shows a group of people assembled around a clearing, where the light, undoubtedly signifying the presence of God, shines brightly. It is an image of missionary arrival that imagines a future which has become our history. The painting was commissioned from the London painter Robert Smirke by the Directors, effectively board members, of the recently established Missionary Society. Smirke had never been to Tahiti, although he had undoubtedly seen Hodges’ paintings. He was, however, experienced at creating images based on literary texts, from Shakespeare to Cervantes. In this case the text was the journal of James Wilson, captain of the ship that delivered the missionaries to Tahiti.</p>\n<p>Captain Wilson, shown in profile, hat-in-hand at the centre-right of the painting, was in many ways a missionary Captain Cook, although his life story was one of sin and suffering, followed by conversion and redemption. A veteran of the Battle of Bunker Hill in the American War of Independence, he joined the East India Company as a naval officer, just as Warren Hastings was expanding the power base of the Company to some consternation back in London.</p>\n<p>Captured by the French, Wilson escaped by swimming to shore where he was recaptured by the forces of Hyder Ali, Sultan of Mysore, and imprisoned for nearly two years. On release he enriched himself working for the Company in India, finding religion only after his retirement back in Britain, still in his thirties.</p>\n<p>Wilson read in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> about the intention to send missionaries to the Pacific and volunteered his services. For evangelicals, motivated by an increasingly central understanding of divine Grace, it was precisely Wilson’s earlier life of sin followed by conversion that demonstrated he was God’s choice for the job.</p>\n<p>The missionary movement gained significant momentum in the early 1790s, prompted, so the story goes, by the Christian cobbler, William Carey’s 1792 pamphlet ‘An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to use means for the Conversion of the Heathen’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> This led to the establishment of ‘the Baptist Society for propagating the Gospel among the Heathen’ at Kettering, which sent Carey to India in June 1793. A letter home in 1794 prompted ministers from a range of churches in Bristol to think about what they could do to build on his efforts.</p>\n<p>This led to David Bogue, the Scottish Minister of an Independent Church in Gosport, Hampshire, to issue an appeal in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em>, central to which was a sense of debt and obligation – both to God, and to early missionaries to the British Isles. According to Bogue, the spirit of <em>Justice</em> cried out:</p>\n<p><em>Ye were once Pagans, living in cruel and abominable idolatry. The servants of Jesus came from other lands, and preached His Gospel among you. Hence your knowledge of salvation. And ought ye not, as an equitable compensation for their kindness, to send messengers to the nations which are in like condition with yourselves of old, to entreat them that they turn from their dumb idols to the living God, and wait for His Son from heaven? Verily their debtors ye are.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Missionary activity was imagined in late 18th century Britain as a ‘Gift of Grace’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup><br>\nBut it was understood as a return gift, acknowledging an obligation placed on Christian Britain, ‘once an island of idolatrous barbarians’,  by a gift of the Word received by pagan ancestors, generations previously. As George Burder, an engraver who became a minister in Coventry, put it on the eve of the founding of the Missionary Society in 1795:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Let us in return “go and do likewise”</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Established in 1795, the Missionary Society, as it was known at the time, consisted of Christians drawn from across the British isles, from dissenting churches as well as evangelicals within the established Church of England. Its constitution declared that ‘The sole object is to spread the knowledge of Christ among heathen and other unenlightened nations’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although its model as a non-denominational society was the <em>Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade</em>, it was neither North America nor Africa that beckoned most strongly. The choice of Tahiti as the first location for missionary activity was influenced by the accounts of Cook’s voyages, which circulated widely, accompanied by prints, some of which were developed from the paintings of Hodges, and others from drawings by John Webber, an artist who accompanied Cook on his third voyage.</p>\n<p>In the years after Cook’s death in 1779, Tahiti became central to the evangelical vision of Thomas Haweis, a Cornish Anglican. Haweis had been chaplain to Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, who had been part of the Methodist evangelical revival during the mid-18th century. She had supported missions in Sierra Leone as well as in North America to both Indigenous Americans as well as formerly enslaved people, and following her death in 1791, Haweis retained considerable influence as her principal trustee.</p>\n<p>Haweis had previously tried, unsuccessfully, to send missionaries to Tahiti with Captain Bligh, so the establishment of the Missionary Society provided another opportunity. He argued that the main barriers to missionary work: inhospitable climates, absolute governments (as found in China and Japan), the prejudices of false religion (such as Islam), and the difficulty of learning new languages, could most easily be overcome in Tahiti where he thought weather was good, food plentiful, government mild, religious prejudices minimal and the language easy to learn. Haweis personally put up a sum of £500, nearly ten years wages for a skilled tradesman at the time, to fund the mission.</p>\n<p>The problem with starting missionary work at Tahiti, however, is that it lies in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, so is far from easy to get to. The Directors of the society decided to buy a ship, the Duff. Preparations were overseen by Captain Wilson who recruited a crew of twenty-two, including his nephew William Wilson as First Mate. William is shown in the painting standing next to his uncle with his right hand in his waistcoat.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Directors recruited thirty missionaries. They including four ordained ministers, but also a roll of late-eighteenth century trades:  six carpenters, a cabinet maker, two bricklayers, a gardener, a cotton manufacturer, a linen draper, two weavers, two tailors, two shoemakers, a hatter, a shopkeeper, a harness maker, a surgeon, a blacksmith, a cooper, a butcher, and for some reason, a gentleman’s servant. These men had between them six wives and three male children, aged 12, 2 and 16 weeks.</p>\n<p>On 10 August 10 1796, the Duff sailed down the Thames with its godly passengers and crew, flying the mission flag – three doves on a purple background, each carrying an olive branch. By the time the ship left English waters on 24 September, the butcher and his wife, struck down by seasickness, had returned to shore and the twelve-year-old boy, already ill, had died of consumption.</p>\n<p>By mid-November the ship was at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, and having struggled to round Cape Horn, Captain Wilson took an easterly route south of the Cape of Good Hope, Australia and New Zealand before heading north to Tahiti. The missionary ship sailed nearly 14,000 miles in 97 days without sight of land, encountering only one other vessel.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>When the sun rose on Sunday 5 March 1797, the Duff lay off Tahiti. The ship was visited by people in canoes, intent on trading. Trade was refused, it being the Holy day, but they remained on deck to observe a religious service.</p>\n<p>The following day, Captain Wilson landed with a number of others, and was taken by two Swedes who had been living on the island for some years to see a large building at Point Venus in Matavai Bay – built for Captain Bligh and known as the British House. The missionary party returned again the following day to take possession of the house and begin preparing it for the eighteen missionaries as well as their five wives and two children who planned to make it their home. They added sleeping compartments, a store room, medical clinic, library and chapel.</p>\n<p>The two children are shown in the foreground of the painting, close to their kneeling mother, the wife of Rowland Hassell, an ‘indian weaver’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> All three are dressed, rather impractically, in gleaming white cloth, a symbol of virtue, but also a bright point in the painting. The presence of children in a painting depicting the birth of a missionary endeavour anticipates the future. The elder child seems to have his gaze directed beyond the frame of the painting, with a finger pointing to something that others do not yet see.</p>\n<p>Ha’amanamani, who had established a formal <em>taiyo</em> exchange relationship with Captain Wilson, of a kind that had become central to the connections of previous European captains such as Cook, is said to have played a prominent role in making these arrangements. He is shown in the painting as a bearded man on the left of the painting in the act of speaking, the object of Wilson’s attention. Although a local priest at the neighbouring island of Mo’orea, he squats in a shaft of light, suggestive of the influence of God.</p>\n<p>In fact, written accounts of the event on 16 March, depicted by the painting, make it clear that Ha’amanamani had his own agenda. Having been exiled from the island of Ra’iatea, he was keen to use his relationship with Wilson to gain access to firearms as well as equipment to fit out the European style ship he was building to invade Ra’iatea. According to Mr Bowell, the shopkeeper,  a rope was stretched around the British house on the day in question to keep the crowd of Tahitians a suitable distance from the missionary party, with Ha’amanamani the only Tahitian to cross the rope.</p>\n<p>He evidently “sat in an odd posture, half bent upon his heels, holding with one hand the rope, and frequently scratching his head and rubbing his eyes with the other”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup>  While this posture is reflected in the painting, the rope is hard to make out in reproductions, but possible to see when standing in front of the painting itself. Ha’amanamani evidently gave a long speech, describing the Gods and important men of the surrounding islands, as well as the European ships and captains that had visited them.</p>\n<p>Ha’amanamani then declared that the missionaries could take the house, trees, fruit and pigs they thought necessary at Matavai, but asked for military support in his campaign to retake Ra’iatea. When this was refused by Captian Wilson, he negotiated for assistance in his shipbuilding efforts, as well as a promise of diplomatic assistance.</p>\n<p>The Directors of the Missionary Society had issued instructions to Captain Wilson in which they declared that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>As an inducement to us to prefer their island, they must give us a full title to the land we may have occasion for, guarantee to us the safety of our property from plunder, the enjoyment of our laws and customs, and the undisturbed exercise of our religion…</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>we recommend that the land shall not be purchased but required, as the condition of us remaining with them: and that the presents we make should not be considered as payments, but as gratuities, the expressions and pledges of our good will.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A gift of grace clearly anticipated significant gifts in return, but the thing that Ha’amanamani was most interested in – European military might – troubled the missionary party.</p>\n<p>This group, shown standing behind Mrs Hassell and the Wilsons, is represented most clearly by the depiction of the carpenter William Henry and his wife, who rather anxiously holds onto his arm, near the front of the group.</p>\n<p>The missionaries are flanked on one side by Peter Haggerstein, one of the Swedes, whose bare chest contrasts with the fuller dress of the missionary party, but whose tattoos, described in written accounts are hard to make out in the painting.</p>\n<p>On their other side the missionary party are framed by the seated figure of Paitia, chief of Matavai. They find their reflection in the group of Tahitians gathered behind Ha’amanamani, representing potential converts. This group also includes two children with their mother, the elder of whom also looks, like the eldest Hassell child, beyond the frame of the image, into the future.</p>\n<p>At the centre of the painting, in a seeming pool of darkness, are two figures, covered from the neck down and sitting on the shoulders of others. These are the young king, Tu (also known as Pomare II), and his wife Tetua, both around twenty years old at the time. The missionaries were surprised to see them carried on land, but happy to bail their own canoes on the water.</p>\n<p>On either side of them are Pomare I and his wife, Itia, who had engaged with Captain Cook and Captain Bligh, and were said to have approved the grant of land at Matavai, when told of the missionaries’ intentions.</p>\n<p>As I looked at the detail of tattoos on the legs of the Tahitian crowd, revealed by the work of museum conservators, I was tempted to see this widescreen image as a snapshot of the meeting of missionaries and Polynesians in 1797. But I had to remind myself of its artefactual nature.</p>\n<p>It was after all a painting created in London by an artist who hadn’t seen any of the events he depicted. It owes its setting to the paintings of Hodges, but was also clearly influenced by the ‘epic representations’ of Benjamin West, an American artist and the official history painter to King George III, who was made President of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1792.</p>\n<p>His most famous work, <em>The Death of General Wolfe</em>, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1771, showed a crowd arranged around the dying general at the Battle of Quebec in 1759. West’s depiction of a seated Native American is echoed by the seated Tahitians in Smirke’s painting.</p>\n<p>The Cession of Matavai is, however, much closer to West’s subsequent painting, <em>Penn’s Treaty with the Indians</em>, depicting a 1683 event when William Penn entered a peace treaty with Tamanend, Chief of the Lenape.</p>\n<p>The painting was commissioned by Thomas Penn, William’s son, who in 1737 used an unsigned and disputed 1686 deed to claim land extending as far West as a man could walk in a day and a half – the so-called “Walking Purchase”.</p>\n<p>Thomas Penn allegedly hired three men to run on a prepared trail, one of whom managed to cover 70 miles. Displaced from their land by this act of trickery, the Lenape allied with the French and attacked Penn’s Creek in 1755, prompting Benjamin Franklin to establish a militia in what had previously been a pacifist Quaker settlement.</p>\n<p>The image of a peaceful treaty and grant of land, painted nearly ninety years later, was a piece of idealistic propaganda that glossed the more complex history of exploitation, expropriation and violence that followed this hopeful initial moment. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Like <em>Penn’s Treaty with the Indians</em>, the <em>Cession of Matavai</em> is a charter painting, depicting a moment of Christian good faith, while at the same time staking a claim to land, as well as a glorious imagined future. Unlike West’s painting, it was made very soon after the events it depicted. The Duff arrived home in July 1798, and by the end of April 1799 <em>the Cession of Matavai</em> was on display at the Royal Academy in London.</p>\n<p>Looking back from our contemporary vantage point, two and a quarter centuries in the future, we can ask how the future that was anticipated by the painting actually unfolded. How do we now remember British overseas missionary activity of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? How far and how quickly did it depart from its early ideals?</p>\n<p>On 6 March 1798, a year after the missionaries arrived, Tahiti was visited by the Nautilus, a trading vessel from Macao. Missionary efforts to prevent the Captain supplying weapons and gunpowder to the Tahitians angered Tu, engaged in his own campaign of expansion and conquest enabled by his access to European weaponry. In fear of possible reprisals, most of the missionaries, their wives and the children left Tahiti on the Nautilus, bound for Port Jackson, as Sydney, Australia, was known at the time.</p>\n<p>Before the Duff arrived back in London, the Tahiti mission had been reduced to a carpenter, a bricklayer, a cooper, three ministers and a minister’s wife. In late 1798, a second shipload of missionaries set sail for Tahiti in the <em>Duff</em>, but the ship was captured by a French privateer near Rio de Janeiro, and the crew and missionaries offloaded at Montevideo, Uruguay.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/art-artists/exhibition-catalogue/ra-sec-vol31-1799\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Academy catalogue</a> from spring 1799 lists the painting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>_The friendly reception of Captain Wilson, of the Ship Duff, and the persons sent out by the London Missionary Society at Otaheite; and the ceremony of the formal grant of the district of Matavai for their use, in presence of the King, Queen, and Chiefs of that island, March 16.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Only in August 1799, after the Royal Academy exhibition had closed, did news reach London that the majority of missionaries had abandoned Tahiti, and it wasn’t until October that the second group of missionaries managed to find their way back to London from South America. By the end of the year, one of the remaining ministers at Tahiti had died and the cooper had left on another visiting ship.</p>\n<p>Those missionaries that remained rapidly discovered that although they had been allowed to stay and to eat food produced at Matavai Bay, they were definitely not regarded as owners of the land.</p>\n<p>The mismatch between imagery, created in London, and reality, experienced in Tahiti, could not have been starker as the eighteenth century drew to a close. It was the following century, however, that would see missionary activity become increasingly central to British understandings of, and engagement with other parts of the world.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>See, <a href=\"https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/capt-james-cook-statue-recovered-from-victoria-harbour-what-s-next-is-undecided-1.24337872\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/capt-james-cook-statue-recovered-from-victoria-harbour-what-s-next-is-undecided-1.24337872</a> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>William Carey, An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens In Which the Religious State of the Different Nations of the World, the Success of Former Undertakings, and the Practicability of Further Undertakings, Are Considered, (Leicester: 1792). <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Richard Lovett, The History of the London Missionary Society 1795-1895, 2 vols.

Their high production cost, however, makes them unlike most of the images and texts circulated by the London Missionary Society during the nineteenth century. Image and text came together in the missionary periodical, some of the most widely circulated publications of the entire century.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> The focus of this chapter is an early image, printed to be bound opposite the title page of the <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Evangelical_Magazine/4hsEAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=evangelical+magazine+1804&amp;pg=PA329&amp;printsec=frontcover\" target=\"_blank\">Evangelical Magazine</a> in January 1804.</p>\n<p>Images had featured at the front of monthly issues of this periodical since its inauguration in 1793, but had generally taken the form of miniature oval portraits of ministers, theologians and occasionally missionaries.</p>\n<p>With one exception these had all been male, and with one other notable exception were all white Europeans – an unclothed portrait of the young <em>Temoteitei</em> from the Marquesas islands had been included in early 1800, following his arrival in London the previous year.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Unlike earlier individual portraits, the stippled engraving from 1804 includes four people – the Dutch missionary Johannes Kicherer, preaching in profile with bible in hand, alongside three Africans who direct their attention at him. The “converted Hottentots”, as they were widely known at the time, travelled to the Netherlands with Kicherer in early 1803, visiting England at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>While the concentration of ink and the detail falls on their faces, their dress is lightly sketched to demonstrate it is contemporary European in form. Clothing was an important signifier of civilisation and conversion – the naked <em>Temoteitei</em> had not converted –  but the covered heads of the two women suggest modesty and respectability. Indeed, they present a significant contrast with the way Saartje Baartman was famously presented in London as the “Hottentot Venus”, a mere seven years later.</p>\n<p>Alongside clothing, names also had the power to signify conversion. Mary, John and Martha – familiar Christian names – are inscribed beneath the image. To contemporary evangelicals these names would have recalled the episode in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A38-42&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"_blank\">Luke’s Gospel (10: 38-42)</a> when Martha busied herself with practical preparations to host Jesus, while her sister Mary sat listening to his words.</p>\n<p>The tensions between Christ’s spiritual message and the practical arrangements needed for its transmission dominated early missionary work, so this choice of names was surely deliberate. Indeed, it seems that in South Africa Mary had previously been known as Sara and John as Klaas.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>John the Baptist lived in the desert on locusts and honey, preparing the way for Jesus, but was also Kicherer’s own first name, but is missing from the inscription in favour of his titles “the Revd. Mr”.</p>\n<p>One surviving copy of this image, published online by the Ephemera Society, includes a hand-written pencil note that states:</p>\n<p><em>The first converted Negroes. I saw them at Orange Street Chapel and shook hands with them all… Mary &amp; John married.</em></p>\n<p>The fact that the “converted Negroes” embodied respectable family life further added to the way they were regarded – Mary gave birth in Holland before returning to South Africa.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>For missionary supporters, “the appearance of three converted Hottentots” in London offered “ocular proofs of the power of Divine Grace on some of the most abject of the human race”, suggesting not only that missionary activity was worth supporting, but also that “Christianity is the most powerful instrument of Civilization”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>A religious tract under the title <em>The Converted Hottentots</em>, published later in 1804, reproduced a version of the same image with Kicherer excluded, but the cheaper woodcut engraving method impacted on its quality, making the converts’ facial features difficult to make out in the smudges of ink.</p>\n<p>The tract included a transcribed dialogue with Kicherer and the converts that took place on 21 November 1803, at the Scots Church in London, originally published in the following month’s Evangelical Magazine. It was chosen for syndication because, according to the preface, it ‘gave the highest satisfaction as to the truths of their conversion and their sincere piety’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>But who were Mary, John and Martha and how did they come to be celebrated alongside a Dutch missionary in the evangelical publications of London ?</p>\n<p>Associated with <em>the Evangelical Magazine</em> from its foundation, the Missionary Society began its own publishing endeavours by producing annual reports. These were initially very much along the lines of a commercial annual report – an account of activity for shareholders, accompanied by a statement of income and expenditure.</p>\n<p>Missionary shareholders were effectively members of the society who subscribed at least a guinea a year, from whom the board of Directors was elected. The Directors constituted a monthly business meeting to supervise the work of the society’s only salaried employee, the secretary.</p>\n<p>In 1803, however, a new publishing venture began, <em>Transactions of the Missionary Society</em>, which made an edited selection of the Society’s correspondence with missionaries available in print – just over 500 pages were included in volume one.</p>\n<p>The first volume told the Society’s story from the establishment in 1795 until the end of 1802. This was prefaced by an introduction that connected this to a longer history of missionary activity stretching back to ‘the great Apostle’, Jesus Christ himself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> The account acknowledged the conditions provided by the Roman empire for the missionary journeys of Paul, and readers were expected to understand that the British empire offered similar opportunities. The expansion of Christianity alongside Spanish and Portuguese empires was briefly described, though it was made clear that Protestants would have done a better job.</p>\n<p>Finally, a brief summary was given of recent work by Protestant missionaries – Danes in Greenland and India, Moravians and the Dutch in various parts of the world, and finally the English Baptists, with William Carey in India.</p>\n<p>The focus for the <em>Transactions</em> then shifts to establishment of the Missionary Society in London and its initial focus on the Pacific. <em>The Duff’s</em> capture on its second voyage is described, as well as the abandonment of Tahiti and the way this shook the endeavour ’to its foundation’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> Regardless, missionary work in Tahiti continued, with a reinforcement of eight missionaries arriving in July 1801.</p>\n<p>The account was not confined to the Pacific but also described early missionary efforts in Britain’s remaining North American colonies, subsequently Canada, as well as missionary ambitions for India. Besides the Pacific, the major focus of the <em>Transactions</em> was the establishment of a second missionary field in South Africa.</p>\n<p>The Cape of Good Hope, on the tip of the African continent, had been maintained as a refreshment station since 1652 by the <em>Vereenigde Ost Indische Compagnie</em> (VOC), the Dutch East India company, one of the world’s first global corporations. The colony, originally centred around a VOC castle, grew as increasing numbers of Europeans settled at the Cape, taking ever larger tracts of land from its indigenous Khoe and San inhabitants. Stock and crops were raised with forced labour, including that of people enslaved at Madagascar, Mozambique, as well as Dutch colonies in Asia.</p>\n<p>Rivals with the British in the mid-17th century, the Dutch had become allies after 1688 when the Glorious Revolution put William of Orange, a Dutch Protestant King, on the English throne. The 18th century saw the British overtake the Dutch in wealth and maritime supremacy, but in 1780 Dutch support for American rebels led to conflict with Britain that weakened the Dutch Republic.</p>\n<p>In early 1795 an alliance of French forces and Dutch Republicans invaded the Netherlands to establish the Batavian Republic, allied with revolutionary France. Britain, then at war with France, invaded the Cape in mid-1795 to protect its shipping routes, at around the same time the Missionary Society was established back in London.</p>\n<p>The Transactions noted that the Society’s earliest missionaries to Africa went to Sierra Leone in 1797, but war kept them on the coast, where by mid-1798 one had died and the other had been dismissed.</p>\n<p>Although British evangelicals connected West Africa with the evils of the slave trade, they also regarded British control of the Cape as an act of providence that might open the continent to Christianity by another route. The problem was that most people in the Cape colony spoke Dutch, making it a difficult place for British missionaries to work.</p>\n<p>This problem appeared to solve itself when the Directors received a letter in early 1797 from Johannes Theodosius Van der Kemp, who heard about the establishment of the Society and wanted to volunteer. Van der Kemp was a fifty-year-old Edinburgh trained medic and experienced soldier who had become an evangelical Christian after losing his wife and daughter, and nearly losing his own life in a boating accident in 1791.</p>\n<p>Like Captain Wilson before him, Van der Kemp was regarded as sent by God. Working with the Directors, he established the Netherlands Missionary Society in Rotterdam, recruiting another volunteer for mission work, Johannes Kicherer, then in his early twenties.</p>\n<p>At the end of 1798 the two Dutchmen, accompanied by two Englishmen, John Edmonds and William Edwards, departed on the <a href=\"https://www.freesettlerorfelon.com/convict_ship_hillsborough.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Hillsborough</a>, a convict ship bound for Botany Bay, part of the same convoy of ships as the Duff on her calamitous second voyage.</p>\n<p>The arrival of these missionaries at the Cape, and the support offered by the British acting governor, General Francis Dundas, generated a reaction among local Christians that led to the formation of the South African Missionary Society.</p>\n<p>While they were in Cape Town, however, the missionaries met three men who literally changed the direction of missionary activity in South Africa. They are reported in the Transactions as ‘Boscheman Captains’ by the names of ‘Vigilant’ and ‘Slaporm’ (slack-arm) and ‘Orlam’ (a term used to describe creole people of indigenous descent, of whom he seems to have been one).</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=arcPAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Boscheman%20Captains&amp;pg=PA476#v=onepage&amp;q=Boscheman%20Captains&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">a letter sent to London in May 1799</a>, Van der Kemp records their names as <em>T’Karoe</em> and <em>T’abekom</em> and ‘Orlam’ as a member of the Coranna nation was called <em>T’zijib,</em> presumably transliterations of their Khoesan names.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup></p>\n<p>When they asked for some ‘good persons’ to ‘be sent among them’ this was interpreted as another act of divine providence and although Van der Kemp felt called to the Cape Colony’s eastern frontier, he agreed that William Edwards should go with them, and if local support was insufficient, for Kicherer to join him.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>The historian Nigel Penn has called the eighteenth century northern border zone with the Cape <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Forgotten_Frontier.html?id=-gX2QTfSkMMC&amp;redir_esc=y\" target=\"_blank\">the Forgotten Frontier</a>. In contrast to regular pitched battles fought in the east of the Cape Colony, this porous frontier with its highly mobile population of indigenous Khoe and San made the expansion of European domination different, but no less violent.</p>\n<p>The central institution of this expanding frontier was the commando, an armed band of farmers of Dutch descent, accompanied by their Khoe servants, who assembled for mutual self-defence. The commando had a great deal in common with what became the ‘posse’ in the American West later in the century, and then as now, when groups of armed and frightened men rode out seeking justice, seemingly defensive actions frequently became offensive actions.</p>\n<p>While the Cape’s cattle and sheep-herding Khoe peoples had much in common with the similarly pastoralist Dutch frontier farmers, known as trekboers, the San (a Khoe term meaning forager) or as they were widely known in the colony ‘Bushmen’, pursued a way of life that depended predominantly on wild foods. This put them into conflict with the new arrivals, whose stock consumed the limited supply of water and grass on which wild animals also depended. In addition, and perhaps more significantly, large numbers of these wild animals were killed by the guns of horse-riding incomers.</p>\n<p>To resist these depredations, San, armed with bows and poisoned arrows, raided pastoralist herds, prompting deadly and frequently indiscriminate commandos against them – men were shot on sight and women and children taken to farms where they were forced to work. When John Barrow was sent by the newly installed British Governor, George Macartney, to investigate in 1797, he was shocked to hear farmers boast of having killed hundreds of San.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was a genocidal conflict over the land, and for the San, literally a fight for survival.</p>\n<p>The ‘Boscheman Captains’ who met the missionaries in Cape Town came from beyond the Roggeveld, an area where the land rises to meet the high plateau of the African interior, and rain only falls during the summer – an arid zone known at the time as ‘Bushmanland’. The arrival of trekboers in the region during the second half of the 18th century initiated a cycle of violence that saw many hundreds of people killed by commandos and hundreds more taken captive.</p>\n<p>In 1798 Floris Visser, a magistrate and farmer, more pious than most, travelled to Stellenbosch to propose a different way of dealing with the San. This so impressed the authorities that he was sent to meet the Governor in Cape Town, who agreed to his proposals. Livestock would be given to them, along with rights to land where they and their children would be safe.</p>\n<p>The idea was that instead of being opposed to colonial expansion, the San should, through the acquisition of property, become part of its pastoral economy, hastening their ‘civilisation’. Macartney encouraged Visser to send San leaders to Cape Town to meet him, where he presumably intended to charm them into cooperating.</p>\n<p>Visser had proposed that ‘captains’ be appointed among the San and given a copper headed staff and brass gorget as a sign of their status – an early method of indirect rule that was partially successful among Khoe groups in the Colony.</p>\n<p>One of the ongoing issues that exacerbated the conflict was that it was very hard to identify recognised leaders with whom to negotiate. The egalitarian nature of San society made it hard for anyone to put themselves forward and receive consistent support from their communities.</p>\n<p>In early 1799, despite the departure of Governor Macartney on health grounds, Visser recruited 187 San men and 284 women and children who were prepared to agree to his proposals, including a number willing to work on Dutch farms, in part because they were literally starving.</p>\n<p><em>T’Karoe,  T’abekom</em> and <em>T’zijib</em> agreed to go to Cape Town following a presentation of gifts that included livestock, beads, knives, tobacco, mirrors, flints and tinder-boxes. According to Van der Kemp, they had been interested by Visser’s prayers and hymns, and wanted to know more about the settlers’ God. It is likely that they had also heard about the Moravian mission at Bavian’s Kloof (now Genadendaal) which had been reestablished in 1792 and was rapidly becoming a refuge for dispossessed Khoe within the colony.</p>\n<p>Without explaining any of this background, the <em>Transactions</em> picked up the story with the missionaries travelling to the inland settlement of Roodezand, guided by Bruntjie, a Khoe elephant hunter from Baviaan’s Kloof. From there, Van der Kemp and Edmonds travelled to the East in their wagon with Bruntjie, while Kicherer and Edwards waited for a promised wagon to take them to ‘Bushmanland’.</p>\n<p>They managed to recruit a local man of Dutch descent by the name of Kramer, as well as Willem Fortuin, of mixed Khoe descent, as well as his wife who spoke ‘the Boschemen’s language’, to join them later – the Transactions declared that ‘so mercifully the Lord seemed preparing their way unto the Gentiles’.[13]</p>\n<p>From Roodezand, the missionaries travelled for a week to Visser’s farm, and from there another two weeks into ‘Bushmanland’, accompanied by five wagons, sixty oxen, two hundred sheep and around fifty people. There they established a small missionary settlement at what they named <em>Blydevooruitzigt Fontein</em>, which the <em>Transactions</em> translated as Happy Prospects Fountain. Its two springs gave it the potential for permanent settlement, including a garden planned to recall a plentiful Eden in the midst of this arid land.</p>\n<p>When the farmers left, Visser’s son stayed to help and his knowledge of |Xam, the language spoken the local San, was invaluable until Fortuin and his wife arrived. Other linguistic tensions plagued the mission, however, and when San joined the settlement, they were divided into two groups – one to learn English with Edwards and the other Dutch with Kicherer. Not long afterwards Edwards took his ‘English’ congregation to live separately.</p>\n<p>By November 1799, Kicherer reported in a letter quoted in the Transactions that they had between 30 and 40 ‘Bushmen’ living at the mission, although he noted in a slightly exasperated tone that numbers had been higher, but ‘they wander to and fro’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>While there were signs of interest in Christianity among the San, Kicherer worried that many residents at the mission were more focused on his regular gifts of tobacco – a quarter pipe after attending each service.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup> Concerned about rapidly depleting supplies, Kicherer took nine San to Cape Town in January 1800 to ask for additional support from the Governor.</p>\n<p>His letter to the Directors following his return in March, suggests he was deeply conflicted, seeking to convince himself he was doing God’s work among ‘the most savage and ferocious of all the people who are known in this country’, but constantly worrying about the meagre and extremely insecure practical arrangements on which his mission depended.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> He described his ‘separation from civilised society’ and the distance from his family and friends as an open wound that grows every day.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup></p>\n<p>As a relatively young man of twenty five, he was strongly tempted to accept the offer of a post as minister to one of the settler communities in the colony. In addition, while Kicherer had been in the Cape, ‘Vigilant’, having killed ‘Orlam’ in a fight, attempted to help himself to the mission’s sheep.</p>\n<p>When Kramer tried to stop him ‘Vigilant’ lunged at him with a knife, but a young San woman threw her kaross, or fur cloak, between the quarrelling men, saving his life. Despite his apparent initial enthusiasm for the missionaries, ‘Vigilant’ later told a local farmer who arrested him that he couldn’t abide the Dutch living in his country.</p>\n<p>When Kicherer returned to the troubled mission with another recruit and a stronger mandate from the Governor, Edwards left to try his luck with Van der Kemp in the East of the Colony. When a group of San attempted to shoot Kicherer with poisoned arrows, he decided to relocate the mission to the Zak River, nearer the Colony, where he might receive greater protection from the colonists.</p>\n<p>At this point, the so-called ‘Bushman Mission’ seems to have shifted its focus from the San to people of Khoe descent, many of whom had lived and worked on Dutch farms and were more interested in becoming Christians.<br>\nAt the end of 1800 additional missionary recruits arrived in South Africa and one of them, William Anderson joined Kicherer when he was once again visiting Cape Town.</p>\n<p>In May 1801, less than two years after commencing the mission, Kicherer led his followers across Bushmanland to the less arid region near the Gariep, or ‘great river’ in the North, where Anderson had gone ahead to establish a mission to the Coranna, or Orlam, a Khoe group that had left the colony.</p>\n<p>It is with a letter from William Anderson dated 6 December 1801 describing this seeming abandonment of the mission to the San that the first volume <em>Transactions</em> ends its account of work on the northern frontier of the Cape Colony, although quite a bit of space was also given to Van der Kemp’s attempts to establish a mission among Xhosa-speakers further East.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the youthful Kicherer’s relative obscurity in the first volume of the <em>Transactions of the Missionary Society</em>, the title page of its second volume, published in 1804, announced in capital letters that it included The Rev. Mr. Kicherer’s <em>Narrative of His Mission to the Hottentots and Boschemen</em>.</p>\n<p>In March 1802, Kicherer had returned to ‘Bushmanland’ from the North, only to have his stock raided and to find venomous snake heads floating in the waterholes.</p>\n<p>After reestablishing his former base at the Zak river, increasing numbers of Khoe arrived at the mission, and by January 1803 when he left his posting once more, there were 600 people living there, of whom 30 adults and 50 children had been baptised.</p>\n<p>The ever restless Kicherer, concerned about his own health as well as that of his recently widowed mother, left the Cape for Europe at the very moment the Colony returned to Dutch control following the Treaty of Amiens.</p>\n<p>News of Kicherer’s arrival in Holland with ‘three African converts’ was reported in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> and their arrival in London anxiously awaited, despite reservations from the Society’s Directors, presumably concerned at the cost of hosting them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>Having witnessed responses to the San he had taken to Cape Town, Kicherer’s commitment to take converts to Europe seems to have been a fairly knowing part of his ongoing campaign to attract additional resources for the mission.</p>\n<p>According to a preface in the Transactions, Mary, John and Martha’s desire to go to Europe was prompted by allegations made within the colony that the religion they were taught by missionaries was not the same as that of European Christians.</p>\n<p>The celebrity status their presence provided Kicherer, however, induced the Directors to ask him to write an account, to literally put his name on the front page of their magazine and to commission an image of the Zak River mission based on his sketch. Kicherer became the hero of the story and while his account may not have exactly glorified his missionary work in South Africa over the previous four years, it certainly cast it in the best possible light for European readers.</p>\n<p>The story told by Kicherer was full of accounts of sincere conversion, but at the same time constructed a portrait of the San as ‘Wild Hottentots’ emphasising the difficulty of conducting missionary work among them, in contrast to the ‘Tame Hottentots’ of the colony. The visual distinction in his sketch map between the rectilinear houses of the ‘Baptised Hottentots’ and the circular structures of the ‘unbaptised Hottentots’ make a similar categorical distinction based on conversion.</p>\n<p>Kicherer compared San huts to pig styes and found their practice of smearing animal fat and pigment onto their bodies disgusting. He was shocked by examples of domestic violence and infanticide, and his descriptions of the degradation of the San provided a backdrop for the ‘Providence of God’ which called them to the fellowship of the Gospel and rendered them ‘the distinguished trophies of his almighty grace’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup></p>\n<p>In religious terms, Kicherer suggested that the San:</p>\n<p><em>have no idea whatever of the Supreme Being… practice no kind of worship’ having only ‘a superstitious reverence of a little insect known by the name the Creeping-leaf, a sight of which, they conceive, indicates something fortunate, and to kill it, they suppose, will bring a curse upon the perpetrator</em></p>\n<p>An 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum would quote Kicherer’s words in its caption for a praying mantis that was displayed there as ‘the Hottentot’s God’, a name retained in contemporary Afrikaans.</p>\n<p>This detail, as well as Kicherer’s account of healing ceremonies involving ‘men… employed to blow, and make a humming over the sick, which they sometimes continue for many hours together’ fits well with later descriptions of San ceremonial practices across southern Africa. Kicherer, however, found these impossible to reconcile with what he regarded as <em>Civilisation</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup></p>\n<p>We can’t know what San made of the Christianity he attempted to teach them, although he noted that those who visited Cape Town compared its Calvinist Church to an ant’s nest and its organ to the sound of a swarm of bees.</p>\n<p>Within Kicherer’s account there are, however, hints of the endemic murderous violence of the Frontier. He suggested that ‘Boschemen… when approaching a white man for the first time… appear in an agony of fear, which discovers itself by the trembling of every limb.’ <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup></p>\n<p>Those who travelled to Cape Town were struck with dread and dismay when they saw men hung in chains for atrocious crimes, as well as when they witnessed a public execution, although Kicherer attempted to make these things object lessons in European justice as an ordinance of God.</p>\n<p>Naming and clothing emerge as central themes in Kicherer’s account. He describes how he gave names to the San who joined the mission, and wrote these across their shoulders in chalk. When they approached him, the first thing they did was turn to show him their backs. His regular trips to the Cape seem to have been motivated, at least partly, by attempts to get hold of European style clothes to dress his congregation, to replace the sheep skins he described as ‘filthy karosses’.</p>\n<p>An account of Kicherer’s testimony to a congregation in London in November 1803 makes it clear that the ‘Hottentot converts’ were intended to illustrate a contrast with the way in which they were reported to have lived before conversion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When these poor Africans are enlightened, a great change takes place in their outward conduct and appearance. Those who before were almost naked, clothe themselves with decency; – from being extremely filthy, they learn to be clean; – and from that laziness which prevailed among them while Heathens, they learn to be diligent, and to cultivate the earth for their subsistence. Thus while the gospel brings to them a spiritual salvation, it becomes also the mean of civilising, we might almost say, of humanising them; and this affords an additional argument for Missionary zeal.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When questioned in front of a congregation with Kicherer acting as translator and mediator, there were few in London who doubted the sincerity of Martha, Mary and John’s conversion and their conviction in the saving grace of Christ. However, there seems to have been a degree of slight of hand in their presentation as the straightforward results of missionary work, alongside these accounts of ‘wild Bushmen’.</p>\n<p>While John van Rooij called himself a ‘pure Hottentot’, both Mary, whose maiden name was Fortuin, and Martha Arendse were regarded in the Cape as ‘Bastaard-Hottentots’, the children of one Khoe parent and one enslaved Malay parent. Mary had worked at the tobacco plantation where Kicherer bought his tobacco, and left this employment to join the mission. Martha had worked as a servant for a Dutch family, but left to join the mission where she was employed by Kicherer as his house-keeper.</p>\n<p>Familiar with the social distinctions established within the Colony over the previous century and a half, all three would have recognised that being Christian, as well as promising other-worldly salvation, enhanced one’s status in this world.</p>\n<p>There were many in the colony who were extremely suspicious of Kicherer’s missionary work, with its emphasis on salvation and education – a view that reasserted itself when the Cape returned to Dutch control in 1803. Martin Hinrich Lichtenstein was a young German doctor and naturalist who arrived at the Cape with General Janssens, the governor appointed by the the Batavian Republic.</p>\n<p>In mid-1805 Lichtenstein was sent to investigate the conditions in Bushmanland and visited Kicherer’s mission at Zak river, of which he noted ‘so much boasting has been made by himself and his friends in Europe’ – an image of the settlement was made for the English edition of Lichtenstein’s account.</p>\n<p>Lichtenstein suggested that both Kicherer and Van der Kemp ‘seemed wholly to forget that mankind was destined to work as well as to pray’. In Kicherer’s absence those remaining at the mission had become dejected, and he claimed were generally ‘Bastard-Hottentots: several of them were entirely white; and the greater part had been baptised before they came hither; some were even born of christian parents’.</p>\n<p>Lichtenstein went as far as to claim that Mary, Martha and John had been baptised at Cape Town by a preacher called Fleck long before they even met Kicherer. While acknowledging that people at the mission had been instructed in Christianity, Lichtenstein asserted that ‘the fact is, that they would have been much better employed in the service of the colonists, providing for their wants by industry, than pursuing, as they did here, lives wholly useless, and abandoned to sloth’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Kicherer arrived back at the Cape in early 1805, Governor Janssens proclaimed a new policy: missions could be established beyond the boundaries of the colony, but must have no communication with its inhabitants, who were prohibited from attending missionary schools. Missionaries were specifically prohibited from recruiting anyone from the service of their masters – no one working for a colonist or who had worked for a colonist in the past year could join a mission.</p>\n<p>With the boundaries of the colony redrawn to include both Kicherer and Van der Kemp’s missions, it was declared that these could remain, but were prohibited from teaching writing. Instead they were encouraged to concentrate on training people to cultivate the land. Finally, missionary settlements were only allowed to offer prayers for the Batavian Republic and the Cape Colony.</p>\n<p>Returning to the Zak River in October 1805 Kicherer found the river had dried up and the mission’s main supporter among the farmers, Floris Visser, had died. A San raid carried off 200 sheep the following month, prompting the newly married Kicherer to conclude that he was, after all, called to become a Government appointed minister in the colonial town of Graaff-Reinet.</p>\n<p>In 1806, less than three years after Mary, John and Martha visited London, and just as the British resumed their control of the Cape, the Zak River Mission was abandoned.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2><strong>Notes</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Jensz, Felicity, and Hanna Acke. “The Form and Function of Nineteenth-Century Missionary Periodicals: Introduction.” <em>Church History</em> 82, no. 2 (2013): 368-73. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0009640713000036\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1017/s0009640713000036</a>. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Sivasundaram, Sujit. _Nature and the Godly Empire : Science and Evangelical Mission in the Pacific, 1795-1850._Cambridge Social and Cultural Histories ; 7.

The museum opened in 1815 and a visitor in 1819 recalled a ‘very fine cameleopard’, suggesting the giraffe was a feature of the museum from its earliest days.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Images of the museum from the 1840s and 1850s, such as that above, have the giraffe at their centre, its head reaching into the space of an overhead skylight. An immobile spectre, this towering creature dominated the museum across three locations and nearly fifty years.</p>\n<p>But how did it come to occupy this imposing position, and who was ultimately responsible for its killing, preservation and transportation to Europe?</p>\n<p>On 24 June 1812, the Rev. John Campbell, a forty-six-year-old Congregational Minister from Scotland, boarded the Isabella convict transport ship at Gravesend in Kent, bound for Africa.</p>\n<p>Formerly an ironmonger in Edinburgh, Campbell had been interested in Africa for decades – he had campaigned for the abolition of the slave trade, and was a friend of John Newton, the former slave trader who penned <em>Amazing Grace</em>.</p>\n<p>Campbell had been the motivating force behind the <em>Society for the Education of Africans</em>, hoping that schooling in Britain might convert young Africans through Grace and the Gospel, enabling them to return and transform their home countries.</p>\n<p>Leading Anglicans feared the impact of an Edinburgh education, resolving in 1799 that the 20 boys and 4 girls sent from Sierra Leone ‘should remain in safety from contamination with any heretical or socialistic ideals’, at an <em>African Academy</em> in Clapham, London.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ordained the minister of Kingsland Chapel in London in early 1804, Campbell met <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/2-the-revd-mr-kicherer-mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Martha, Mary and John, the South African visitors</a>, shortly after they arrived with Rev. Kicherer [<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/2-the-revd-mr-kicherer-mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a>].</p>\n<p>Although he had never been to the continent of Africa, Campbell had experience of preaching tours across the highlands and islands of Scotland, as well as the North of England.</p>\n<p>Campbell was asked to visit the Cape by the Directors of the Missionary Society, following the death of Johannes van der Kemp at the end of 1811. Van der Kemp had been in the process of preparing to launch a mission to Madagascar, where his very young formerly enslaved wife originally came from.</p>\n<p>The missionaries’ advocacy for the indigenous Khoisan people of the Cape, and the attention they had drawn to their abusive treatment by local farmers, had come to a head, and the Cape government was in the process of launching a commission to investigate their charges.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>What is more, Hinrich Lichtenstein had just published the English translation of his <em>Travels in Southern Africa between the years 1803 and 1806</em>, which included extremely unflattering descriptions of both van der Kemp and his missionary settlement Bethelsdorp.</p>\n<p>This reflected suspicion among the settlers of what they called <em>Bedelaarsdorp</em> (Beggar’s village), partly due to the reluctance of its residents to labour on local farms.</p>\n<p>Lichtenstein ridiculed both Van der Kemp’s adoption of local forms of dress, such as leather sandals, and questioned the marriages of both Van der Kemp and his fellow Bethelsdorp missionary, James Read, to extremely young non-white women.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>Campbell was tasked with visiting the mission stations in Africa to investigate. He was also asked:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>… to establish such regulations… as might be most conducive to the attainment of the great end proposed – the conversion of the heathen, keeping in view at the same time the promotion of their civilization.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Arriving at Cape Town after four months at sea, Campbell met friends including Kicherer, who had been minister of the Dutch Reformed Church at Graaf-Reinet since his return to South Africa. The Cape Colony had returned to British control in 1806 following a naval invasion during the Napoleonic wars, so Britain’s 1807 Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade applied there, at least in theory. Slavery, but also the trade in enslaved people, continued to operate however, and Campbell witnessed domestic slavery first hand at the Cape.</p>\n<p>While he was at Cape Town, a ship carrying captives from Madagascar and Mozambique was seized and each captive was apprenticed to a Cape master for fourteen years, during which they were supposed to learn a trade, to read and the principles of Christianity. While decrying slavery as ‘a condition which shocks human nature’ and calling the prohibition on marriage by the enslaved ‘not only an act of great injustice… but a heinous sin against God’, Campbell felt that the ‘temporary captivity’ of apprentices might prove a blessing to their home countries, if they ever returned there.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>Campbell’s first visits beyond Cape Town were to the Moravian missions of Groenekloef (now Mamre, established in 1808), and Genadendal (the place of Grace), South Africa’s earliest Christian mission. Established in 1738, it was abandoned for fifty years before being re-established in 1792.</p>\n<p>Campbell visited the homes of the indigenous Khoekhoen families living at these missions, remarking on their cleanliness as well as their ‘mostly decent’ dress, while noticing that some still dressed in loose sheepskins.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> Echoing Lichtenstein’s description of the orderliness of these settlements, he nevertheless wrote down frightful stories about encounters with African animals, including a leopard attack.</p>\n<p>It was not until mid-February 1813 that Campbell set off to inspect the Society’s own mission stations, going first to Bethelsdorp at Algoa Bay in the eastern Cape, Van der Kemp’s mission since 1803.</p>\n<p>Travelling from Cape Town with two wagons, drawn by teams of twelve and fourteen oxen, Campbell was almost entirely reliant on the expertise and know-how of his Khoekhoen guides.</p>\n<p>The party was overseen by Cupido Kakkerlak (Cupid Cockroach in Afrikaans), who Campbell called the group’s ‘travelling director’,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> a Khoe preacher from Bethelsdorp who had been baptised by Van der Kemp in 1801.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>In addition ‘Britannia’, a Gonaqua man, drove the other wagon, while ‘John’ and ‘Michael’ led the oxen and ‘Elizabeth’ and ‘Sarah’ took care of cooking, washing, finding water as well as making regular coffees for the travelling party.</p>\n<p>During the month long journey, Campbell formed an attachment to his companions, writing that they were:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>far from being so barbarous a race as they are usually supposed to be by Europeans… They have nothing more savage about them than the peasants in England. I have seen families in London living in more dirty hovels than ever I saw Hottentots, and many in London have committed far more atrocious deeds than any I have ever heard the Hottentots charged with.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I think the Hottentot mind is better cultivated than the minds of many in the lower ranks in London; and I should expect to be much better served, and to be more safe in travelling with twenty Hottentots, than with twenty Europeans.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The mission at Bethelsdorp was a rare place where Khoekhoen could live a fairly independent life within the colony, apart from when pressed to serve in the Cape Regiment – the majority of Khoekhoe not living at missions were forced to work as farm labourers. Vocational training seems to have been a strand at the mission, and William Corner, a Black missionary from Demerara, a Dutch colony in the Caribbean, had been training carpentry apprentices for around a year when Campbell arrived.</p>\n<p>One of these was Jan Tzatzoe, son of a Xhosa chief of the amaNtinde lineage, who would go on to play a key role in the expansion of Christianity in South Africa. Tzatzoe presented Campbell with a wooden box he had made in the cabinet maker’s style ‘for containing any varieties I might happen to obtain higher up in Africa’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Campbell was definitely not as impressed by the physical appearance of Bethelsdorp as he had been by Genadendal – he compared its irregularity to Norwich or Manchester – some houses having been abandoned. The lack of water supply also meant there weren’t any trees or gardens. He was equally unimpressed by the fact that many people still dressed in animal skins, but blamed Van der Kemp, suggesting he ‘seems to have judged it necessary, rather to imitate the savage in appearance, than to induce the savage to imitate him’! ⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>Visiting farms a mile and a half away, however, Campbell was impressed by the amount of cultivated land and when describing the Bethelsdorp cattle herd, stated that he had never seen so many beasts in one place apart from at Smithfield market in London.</p>\n<p>Cupido, who had been born around 1760 grew up on a farm, and did his time as a farm labourer. However, he became a key figure among the founders of Betheldorp, when land had been allocated for the mission by Batavian authorities in 1803-4.</p>\n<p>At Bethelsdorp, Cupido worked for himself as a sawyer and wood trader, while his wife made soap for sale. Together they built up a herd of ten oxen and purchased a wagon. The church became increasingly important in Cupido’s life, and he was one of the first people at the mission to learn to read and write.</p>\n<p>While he thought there was still room for improvement, Campbell concluded that during its first decade Bethelsdorp had become a self-sustaining Christian community of around a thousand people, with over two thousand cattle. A significant measure of this, in Campbell’s eyes, was the money they raised to support the poor and sick, as well as missionary work elsewhere.</p>\n<p>From Bethelsdorp, a party of five wagons set off in April 1813, intent on examining potential mission sites in Albany, recently cleared of its human inhabitants by a combination of Khoekhoen and British troops during the fourth frontier war of 1811-12. It was while travelling through this recently depopulated landscape that Campbell first encountered large African mammals such as elephants and buffaloes.</p>\n<p>It was the thirty Khoekhoen in the party, however, including two who had originally been part of the Zak River mission [<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/2-the-revd-mr-kicherer-mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a>], who did all the hunting, at times mounted on oxen. They skinned and cut up animals to make biltong (preserved meat) and presented Campbell with various trophies, including the horns of the first buffalo they shot. Somewhere along the way, Campbell seems to have acquired his own sheepskin cloak or kaross, which he appreciated on cold nights.</p>\n<p>Arriving at Graaf-Reinet at the end of April, Campbell met <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/2-the-revd-mr-kicherer-mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Kicherer, Martha, Mary and John</a>, but also William Burchell, a young botanist and collector who travelled in the interior of South Africa between June 1811 and April 1815.</p>\n<p>Writing to his mother, just before he set off from Cape Town, Burchell declared:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I do not consider myself out of the way of making money, when I think of the value of what I shall be able to obtain in my journey. I have been informed that a skin of the Camelopard which was shot in that country where I am going to, was sold in England for fifteen hundred pounds and though I cannot hope that if I bring one home it will sell for half that sum, yet should I be so fortunate as to discover the Unicorn, which has been supposed to exist in this part of Africa, I have not the least doubt of making five times that sum.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Discussed in the same breath as the unicorn, the giraffe had until recently been considered a quasi-mythical beast in Europe, known from Classical texts that described it as camel-like with the skin markings of a leopard – hence camel-leopard.</p>\n<p>The first skin and skeleton to arrive in England had been collected at the Cape in the late 1770s by William Paterson, another Scotsman, and was presented by his patron Lady Strathmore to John Hunter, whose anatomy collections became the Hunterian Museum at London’s Royal College of Surgeons.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At around the same time Robert Jacob Gordon, a Dutch born soldier from the Scotch brigade, sent a giraffe skin to Holland, and a few years later the French traveller François Le Vaillant sent another to Paris that ended up in the Natural History Museum in Paris.</p>\n<p>Burchell had initially travelled into the interior from Cape Town with missionaries, using the Society’s stations as the stopping points on his journey. Like Campbell, he was dependent on Khoekhoen guides and key among them was Stoffel Speelman, recently discharged from the Cape Regiment.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Like Cupido, Speelman took charge of the practical aspects of the journey, finding water for the cattle and doing most of the hunting – for food as well as Natural History collecting. Burchell trained his assistants to cut and remove skins in a way that would enable subsequent taxidermy. In a journal entry, Burchell stated that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In order to encourage Speelman in being diligent to shoot birds for my collection I have promised him a rix dollar for every dozen skins I preserve: And to whoever shall bring down a camelopardalis, any thing of my bartering goods he may choose.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Burchell and Speelman twice made the dangerous journey on the route they pioneered between Graaf Reinet and Klaarwater, across so-called ‘Bushmanland’, and Campbell intended to follow in their footsteps.</p>\n<p>At Graaf-Reinet, Burchell advised Campbell, but also agreed that one of his party could join them as a guide. How much they discussed Natural History collecting is unclear, but Burchell’s wagons must have already been impressively full, since he collected a total of 63,000 items during his travels.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Campbell’s party of three wagons and numerous livestock and dogs completed this journey in early June 1813 when they crossed what he called the ‘Great River’, later known as the Orange, and now mostly called the Gariep, a transliteration of the Khoe words Kai !Garib, meaning ‘great river’.</p>\n<p>Campbell’s published account of the journey describes them entering what he called ‘Griqualand’, but at the time was no such thing. The people they were on their way to see called themselves ‘Bastaard Hottentoten’ or just plain ‘Bastaards’, in acknowledgement of their mixed ancestry.</p>\n<p>During his visit, Campbell persuaded them to abandon this term on account of “the offensiveness of the word to an English or Dutch ear”, and to rename themselves Griqua, since the Khoekhoen group they were most descended from was the “Gurigriqua”.They also renamed Klaarwater (Clear Water), their main settlement, Griqua Town – now mostly known as Griekwastad.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The settlement was dominated at the time by the Kok and Barends families, fugitives from the expanding Cape Colony, who prospered by trading and raiding across the frontier. The advantages that guns and horses gave them over other residents of the African interior were considerable.</p>\n<p>A mission had been established at Kok’s kraal in 1802, but relocated along with the people to Klaarwater shortly afterwards. By 1813 Campbell recorded a population of around 1300 Griquas, with another 1300 Corannas (another mixed Khoekhoen group) under their protection.</p>\n<p>Campbell published an image of ‘Griquatown’ in his book, but this had considerably more artistic merit than most of the other images, such as that of Bethelsdorp above, which were based on his own generally perspective-less sketches. The image derived from a drawing made by none other than William Burchell, who had given it to William Anderson. Anderson was a missionary of the Society who had worked in the region since 1801.</p>\n<p>Burchell was extremely surprised and somewhat upset when he finally arrived back in Cape Town in 1815 and found that the drawing had not only been sent to England, but that it had found its way into Campbell’s account as a print, with no acknowledgment of its original source.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Another pair of drawings, made by Burchell at Klaarwater in December 1811, show a giraffe skin propped up on a wooden scaffold in the midst of houses at the settlement, presumably in the process of being preserved for Burchell’s collection.</p>\n<p>Although Campbell first saw giraffes while approaching the Orange River in June 1813, it was only at the end of July, following his return from a visit to Tswana settlements further north, that his party successfully shot one near Griqua Town.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup> While writing letters back to London, Campbell heard musket shots and was fetched by a messenger who told him that the hunters wanted him to see the giraffe before it died.</p>\n<p>When he arrived, it had already collapsed, but Campbell was amazed by its height, suggesting that a high horse could have walked between its legs. Presented with the skin to take to England by the person who shot it, presumably inspired by Burchell’s keenness on acquiring a similar skin a year before, Campbell happily added it to his collection.</p>\n<p>In the days that followed, Campbell was gratified when the newly constituted ‘Griqua’, having agreed to a code of laws, system of justice and his proposal they should adopt their own currency, decided to rename one of their satellite settlements Campbell in his honour.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Following the Gariep downstream before travelling south through Namaqualand, Campbell’s party arrived back at Cape Town at the very end of 1813.</p>\n<p>Meeting John Craddock, the Governor of the colony early in the new year, Campbell was granted additional land for a new mission in Albany which he optimistically named Theopolis, the city of God.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Returning to Britain, Campbell arrived at Plymouth in May 1814, and immediately began speaking and preaching about his journey – the giraffe skin was sent to the London taxidermist Benjamin Leadbeater for preparation.</p>\n<p>Early in 1815, Campbell published an account of his journey – the frontispiece of which shows its diminutive author sheltering from the African sun under an umbrella in a pose reminiscent of the contemporary ‘selfie’.</p>\n<p>The caption refers to the “waggons &amp;c” pictured “on the Banks of the Great or Orange River”. While the landscape, and particularly the oxen, appear almost European, there is an element of the image that make it clear Campbell must be in Africa – the giraffe grazing on a tree in the background. This is an echo of the giraffe that Le Vaillant had himself depicted alongside for his own frontispiece a quarter century earlier.</p>\n<p>Campbell’s return to London, accompanied all manner of trophies from his travels, not least the skin of a giraffe, appears to been the main reason why in the succeeding months the Missionary Society decided to take a set of nine rooms in the Old Jewry near Cheapside in the City of London, that included:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>some for the reception of those curiosities which have been transmitted from Otaheite, China, South America, and particularly from South Africa. These will be prepared for public inspection as soon as possible.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In June 1813, the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> had been rebadged the <em>Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle.</em> Missionary news was published under a separate header at the back of the magazine and could be sent separately to Auxiliary Missionary Societies on a monthly basis.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> for April 1815, shortly after the publication of Campbell’s book, that the opening of the Missionary Museum in London was announced. Members and friends of the society were invited to apply for a ticket to visit on Tuesday and Thursdays between 11am and 3pm from any of the Directors.</p>\n<p>There, they would be able to gaze upwards at the towering giraffe, a decade before the first living giraffe made its way to the British Isles.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> A further note was added, soliciting further donations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Ladies and gentlemen, possessed of any curious articles suited to this collection, and disposed to part with them, will greatly oblige the Society by presenting them to the Directors to enrich their Museum.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In April 1816 ‘idols of silver’ and copper arrived for the museum from Ballari in Karnataka, South India. In September, further ‘valuable curiosities’ from South Africa were announced.</p>\n<p>These had been sent by Rev. Mr George Thom, who had travelled to South Africa with Campbell on his way to a missionary posting in Calcutta, but had been asked to remain in Cape Town as the Missionary Society’s agent. These items included:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>skins of a large lion, tyger, leopard, ant-eater, wild boar, lynx, goo, spring buck, kangaroo. &amp; C.; together with various kinds of serpents – the puff-adder, the camelion and La Masité (commonly called The Hottentot’s God).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though most of these items, like the giraffe, spoke more to South Africa’s natural history than to its religious state, the Afrikaans name for the praying mantis made it clear that the religious understandings of southern African people were not unrelated to the country’s wild creatures.</p>\n<p>Soon afterwards ‘London’ was appended to the Missionary Society’s official name, partly to distinguish it from the Anglican Church Missionary Society, established in 1799. However, this choice of name also seems to have connected to the Society’s acquiring a physical headquarters with an attached museum in the city.</p>\n<p>In September 1817, following his return to London, William Burchell presented 43 animals skins, including a pair of giraffes, not to the Missionary Museum but to the British Museum. Upset by the way in which the skins were subsequently neglected and allowed to decay, he complained and a number were eventually prepared for display.</p>\n<p>By 1838 two of his giraffes were on display at the top of the British Museum’s staircase, alongside the smaller giraffe from the Hunterian collection, the first to reach Britain. An 1845 watercolour by George Scharf of the staircase at the British Museum features this trio of giraffes, accompanied by a diminutive rhinoceros.</p>\n<p>While the skulls of the male and female giraffe presented to the British Museum by Burchell have survived, one bisected and the other with its horns sawn off, little else remains of the three giraffes shot and skinned near Klaarwater between October 1812 and July 1813. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum records that the giraffe was shot in Griqua country by Mr Campbell’s party, but also describes it in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This very peculiar animal inhabits the interior parts of Africa, and the forests of Ethiopia. It is remarkable for the great disproportion of height between the fore and hind parts. The head is like that of a Stag; the neck is slender; the tail long, with strong hairs at the end; the whole is of a dirty white, marked with large broad rusty spots. It is very timid, but not swift; it runs awkwardly, and is easily taken. It browses on trees, yet can feed on the grass, and drinks water from the brook. Its height is from fifteen to seventeen feet, but some have been seen more than twenty feet. The specimen is about sixteen feet.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Giraffe was known to the Romans in early times. It appears among the figures in the assemblage of eastern animals in the celebrated Praenestine Pavement, made by the direction of Sylla, and is represented both grazing and browsing, in its natural attitudes. It was exhibited at Rome by the popular Caesar, among other animals, in the Circasean Games.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While classical knowledge of giraffes was recalled in this catalogue description, the detailed practical knowledge of hunters such as Stoffel Speelman and Cupido Kakkerlak, as well as their central role directing the journeys undertaken by both Campbell and Burchell, was essentially obscured from view when these giraffes were displayed in London.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>John Griscom, <em>A year in Europe: comprising a journal of observations in England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Switzerland, the north of Italy, and Holland.

He had left England on a Sunday morning, six months earlier, along with 187 convicts, a third of whom were younger than he was.</p>\n<p>Ellis had been a junior gardener when he read the letters sent by his pastor, <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">John Campbell, from South Africa</a>. Yearning to become a missionary, he trained for a year, was ordained and then married – the risks of sending unmarried missionaries into the world having now been recognised.</p>\n<p>Mary Mercy Moor, his wife, had been orphaned as a child but was inspired to become a missionary after hearing Campbell speak about his journey in London. As a young woman, however, the only way viable way to embark on a life as a missionary in 1815 was as a missionary wife. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The voyage took the pair via Rio de Janeiro, where they arrived at the same time as a slave ship from Africa, its deck crowded with people of a similar age. But William and Mary were not slaves or convicts, and their journey marked the commencement of another sort of life.</p>\n<p>Waiting in New South Wales for onward transport to Tahiti, they stayed at Parramatta with the Hassells, the original missionary family <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-cession-of-matavai/\" target=\"_blank\">depicted in the Cession of Matavai</a>, who had left Tahiti in 1798.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was here that they would have heard of the arrival in Sydney harbour of the Queen Charlotte, a ship that traded with the islands, until recently captained by William Shelley, another former missionary from the first Duff voyage.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Alongside sandalwood and pork, another, extremely unusual, cargo was unloaded – ‘nailed up in a case’ by missionaries at Tahiti. It was addressed to Joseph Hardcastle, Treasurer of the Missionary Society in London, and was making William and Mary’s journey in reverse.</p>\n<p>We have to imagine the wooden packing case being carried into the Parramatta home of Samuel Marsden, the penal colony’s senior churchman, who two years previously had begun a mission to New Zealand under the aegis of the Anglican Church Missionary Society. We don’t know who pulled the nails out of the case, but it is likely to have been one of the many convicts who worked for Marsden, herding sheep on the thousands of acres of Australian bush, granted to Marsden by the governor.</p>\n<p>William and Mary Ellis had likely gazed up at <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Campbell’s giraffe</a> in the newly opened Missionary Museum in London a year before, but the artefacts revealed in Parramatta – carved from wood and whale bone and bound with colourful feathers – were unlike any they had seen. In a letter to Hardcastle, dated 31 October 1816, Marsden described them as ‘THE IDOL GODS OF OTAHEITE’:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;They are now lying prostrate on the table before me; and were we not certain of the fact, we could not believe that any human beings could place their salvation in these wretched images, and offer up human sacrifices to avert their anger</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>Whether this Halloween display was deliberate on Marsden’s part is hard to know from a distance of two centuries, but the date’s significance could not have been lost on the many Irish rebels transported to the penal colony. How the superstitious sailors of the Willerby, the ship on which Marsden forwarded the case to London, regarded these ‘idol gods’ can only be imagined, but when the ship was wrecked off Ambon Island, in what is now Indonesia, there must have been some who blamed this ominous cargo.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>News of these ‘Idol Gods’ reached London in early 1818. An announcement in February’s <em>Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle</em> stated that they ‘will enrich the Museum of the Society, and we shall probably give a print of them in a future number of this work’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>In April the Missionary Society initiated a new quarterly publication, <em>Missionary Sketches</em>, <em>for the use of weekly and monthly contributors to the Missionary Society.</em> Each issue consisted of a single folded sheet, the front cover given over to a large printed illustration.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the first issue had to report that the ‘Idol Gods’ had still not arrived, but that ‘correct sketches’ of them would be presented to readers if they did. As a result, the cover showed an ancient Trimurti sculpture from the Elephanta caves in Mumbai Harbour, India, with Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu presented as a three-headed being, suggestive of the form of the Christian Trinity.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>When the ‘Idol Gods’ still hadn’t arrived by May, readers of the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> were notified ‘in order to prevent unnecessary trouble and disappointment’ – presumably anticipating the arrival of missionary supporters from around the country for the Society’s 24th annual general meeting in London.</p>\n<p>In the sermon that opened this meeting, the Rev Ralph Wardlaw from Glasgow preached on a verse from Acts xvii 16:</p>\n<p><em>&gt; Now, while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</em></p>\n<p>Wardlaw proposed that ‘the contemplation of the idolatries of the Heathen’ should keep alive and stimulate the missionary spirit, inspiring indignant grief at the dishonour done to God, amazement at human weakness, abhorrence of human impiety, as well as compassion for human wretchedness.</p>\n<p>His sermon, however, cautioned his listeners not to be complacent, since ‘the guilt of idolatry… attaches itself to many who little imagine that they are at all chargeable with any thing of the kind’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was at the Society’s business meeting the following day that it was proposed and agreed that the official name of the Society would become the <em>London Missionary Society,</em> a move which made sense given the establishment of the Society’s headquarters and museum in the city, three years earlier.</p>\n<p>In July, the front page of the second issue of  <em>Missionary Sketches</em> was taken up by an image of <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mantis, the Soothsayer</em>, o_r the Hottentot’s God_</a>, based on the preserved specimen sent to Missionary Museum in 1816 by the Rev. George Thom from South Africa.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> In August, the same appeared in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup></p>\n<p>Finally, in September, the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> announced that ‘the long-expected Idols… are at length arrived in London’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup> – how they escaped the wreck of the Willerby was not reported, but they must have been rescued by the surgeon, Mr Hill, to whom Marsden had entrusted them.</p>\n<p>In the third issue of <em>Missionary Sketches,</em> published in October 1818, the image given at the beginning of this chapter finally appeared, alongside a description of ten ‘Idols’, under the title <em>The family Idols of Pomare, which he relinquished, and sent to the Missionaries at Eimeo, either to be burnt, or sent to the Society</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>In December 1818, the same image featured in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> alongside shorter descriptions – an image of conversion to rival that of <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Mary, John and Martha</a> fifteen years earlier.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup></p>\n<p>How was it that these ‘idol gods’ were given up by Tu (Pomare II), the ‘young king’ depicted on sitting on another man’s shoulders in <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-cession-of-matavai/\" target=\"_blank\">the Cession of Matavai</a>? How had the Society’s first mission gone from abject disaster to such conspicuous success in less than two decades?</p>\n<p>For evangelicals at the time, the answer was divine Grace – a missionary hymn sung soon after their arrival in England provides an insight, associating the renunciation of idols with the power and grace of ‘Britain’s God… by British Christians taught’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>From our perspective, two centuries later, however, it seems necessary to attempt to understand something of what had happened in Tahiti during those two decades, and the motivations that guided Pomare’s actions.</p>\n<p>The exodus of missionaries from Tahiti in March 1798 had been prompted by a conflict with Tu, the young king who became Pomare II. He had been upset when missionaries tried to prevent a visiting ship supplying him with guns and powder and had a number of them publicly stripped.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards Tu’s father, Pomare I, under whose protection the remaining seven missionaries placed themselves, tried to enlist their support in his military efforts.</p>\n<p>Politically, the situation at Tahiti was unstable, with conflict emerging between father and son. In November 1798, when Tu supported the execution of his ally, the priest Ha’amanamani who had arranged the settlement of missionaries at Matavai a year before, it was recorded of Tu in the missionary journal that:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;We believe he is capable of committing any wickedness the devil, his carnal mind, and bloodthirsty followers may excite him to, if God did not restrain him.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup></em></p>\n<p>In January 1800, much to the disapproval of the missionaries, his father, Pomare I, acquired a ‘a carronade, two swivels, several muskets and a great deal of ammunition’ from a visiting ship, from which four sailors also deserted to assist him.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup></p>\n<p>In July 1801, the mission was reinforced with eight new missionaries as well as one who had previously been at Tonga, arriving with a fresh supply of stores.</p>\n<p>In 1802, Henry Nott, a bricklayer had remained at Tahiti since the arrival of the Duff in 1797, began preaching around the island, having developed sufficient command of Tahitian. It was during his preaching tour that Nott visited the <em>marae</em> or sacred place of Oro the god of war at Atahuru.</p>\n<p>Here, Tu seized the <em>to’o</em> or representation of the God, described by the missionaries as a ‘billet of wood’, initiating a conflict that pitted him once more against his father.</p>\n<p>Conflict and violence spiralled across the island, accompanied by death and disease, and it was at around this time that Tu began to show an interest in missionary’ preaching.</p>\n<p>Many Tahitians blamed the increasingly dire situation on the arrival of Europeans, connecting the political expansionism of Pomare I and Tu to their alliances with Europeans over the previous four decades. These included deploying the military expertise of mutineers from the Bounty during the late 1780s to establish their preeminence. The missionaries, however, understood their suffering as God’s judgement for the impieties of the Tahitians.</p>\n<p>In September 1803 Pomare I died, changing the calculus of Tahitian politics.</p>\n<p>Adopting the name Pomare II, Tu consolidated his position with advice from a Hawaiian courtier, recently returned from Europe. He began learning to read and write and attempted to persuade the missionaries not to teach these skills to other Tahitians.</p>\n<p>In July 1805, Pomare began writing directly to the Directors of the Missionary Society in London, receiving a response in late 1806. In his subsequent reply, dated 1 January 1807, Pomare II sought to deepen his relationship with the directors, praising Jehovah and agreeing to ‘banish Oro, and send him to Raiatea’, the island from which the cult of the war god had come, and which remained its spiritual centre. In return, Pomare II asked for ‘property and cloth as well as muskets, powder, paper, ink and pens, as well as ‘all the curious things that you have in England’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup></p>\n<p>Towards the end of 1808, discontent with Pomare II and his close alliance with the missionaries initiated a rebellion, as a result of which all but four of the unmarried missionaries left Tahiti for the island of Huahine. The culmination of the conflict was a major battle on 22 December 1808 that saw Pomare II and his allies defeated, despite a prophet of Oro promising them victory.</p>\n<p>The rebels ravaged Matavai, from where Pomare II and the remaining missionaries fled to the neighbouring island of Moorea. From there, all the missionaries except Henry Nott went to Huahine, and in October 1809 all but one left for Australia.</p>\n<p>Disillusioned with Oro, Pomare II spent a great deal of time reading and thinking, developing a deeper interest in the God of the missionaries through the counsel of Henry Nott. He told Nott in July 1812 that he wanted to be baptised and when questioned on the sincerity of his commitment, Pomare II stated that ‘You do not know the thoughts of my heart, nor I yours, but God does’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>In August 1813 Pomare returned to Tahiti to reassert his authority – the missionaries worried that he would be exposed to alcohol and its attendant temptations. Nevertheless, his renunciation of ‘the idol gods and the religion of his country’ impressed the missionaries.</p>\n<p>Visiting Tahiti, they discovered a prayer-meeting had been instituted with the names of the <em>Pure Atua</em> – praying people – recorded in a book. By the end of 1814 this included 204 names. In January 1815 the missionaries wrote to London, concerned that Pomare wanted to be the first Christian to be baptised among his people, while remaining, according to them, ‘a slave to drinking’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup></p>\n<p>In February 1815, the priest of Papetoai in Moorea, a man named Patii, hit upon a way to convince the missionaries of the true renunciation of the old gods. He took the <em>to’o,</em> or God images, from the <em>marae</em> and created a pyre on the beach. Reciting their names and pedigrees, he stripped them f their coconut fibre wrapping and feathers one by one before casting them into the fire.</p>\n<p>This action initiated an outburst of iconoclasm that spread rapidly across both Moorea and Tahiti, with Pomare encouraging people to join this festival of flames.</p>\n<p>An attempt to kill the <em>Pure Atua</em> (praying people) of Tahiti saw them flee once more to Moorea, but they subsequently returned to Tahiti with Pomare II at their head. A battle on 12 November 1815, when the Christians were attacked at church, proved decisive.</p>\n<p>Whether the events in Tahiti during 1815 were related to the eruption of Mount Tambora, a volcano on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa, on 10 April is unclear from missionary accounts. However, this was one of the largest volcanic events ever recorded and atmospheric ash generated brilliantly coloured sunsets all over the world for months. How these portents were regarded in Tahiti can only be imagined.</p>\n<p>Pomare’s restraint in exerting retribution following his victory, including offering respectful burial to enemies killed in battle, seems to have persuaded his erstwhile enemies to accept his overlordship as a Christian king. Following the victory, Pomare set about destroying ‘gods’ and maraes, but also building churches as new places of worship.</p>\n<p>If the <em>to’o</em> had been vehicles of spiritual power or <em>mana</em>, the new Christians of Tahiti became anxious to get hold of printed copies of the bible – the vehicle through spiritual power in the form of Grace could be acquired, overwhelming missionary capacity to meet their demand.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup></p>\n<p>The picture that emerges is one of religious and societal transformation in which European missionaries, even by their own admission, were not the principal actors – for most of the key events on Tahiti itself, the missionaries remained in a peripheral location on the island of Moorea, hearing news of what unfolded second-hand.</p>\n<p>It was here that they were sent the ‘family idols’ by Pomare II, together with his letter of explanation, dated February 19, 1816. A missionary translation printed in the Missionary Chronicle for January 1818 renders the letter:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;Friends,</em><br>\n<em>May you be saved by Jehovah and Jesus Christ our Saviour. This is my speech to you, my friends. I wish you to send those Idols to Britane for the Missionary Society, that they may know the likeness of the gods that Tahiti worshipped. These were my own idols, belonging to our family from the time of Taaroamanahune even to Vairaatoa (Pomare I); and when he died he left them to me. And now, having been made acquainted with the true God, with Jehovah, He is my God, and when this body of mine shall be dissolved in death, may the Three-One save me!</em><br>\n<em>….The principal idol, that has the red feathers of the Otuu is Temeharo, that is his name, look you, you may know it by the red feathers; that was Vairaatoa’s own god, and those feathers were from the ship of Lieutenant Watts (Lady Penrhyn, 1788); it was Vairaatoa that set them himself about the idol. If you think proper, you may burn them all in the fire; or, if you like, send them to your country, for the inspection of the people of Europe, that they may satisfy their curiosity, and know Tahiti’s foolish gods!</em></p>\n<p><em>…Let me know also, what news there may be from Europe and from Port Jackson. Perhaps King George may be dead, let me know. I shall not go around Tahiti before the month of March.</em> <em>May you be saved, my friends, by Jehovah, and Jesus Christ the only Saviour by whom we sinners can be saved.</em></p>\n<p><em>POMARE, King of Tahiti, &amp;c. *C.</em></p>\n<p><em>Tahiti Motuta, Feb 19. 1816.</em></p>\n<p>Could Pomare II have been responding to the appeal for ‘curious articles’ for the Missionary Museum printed the April 1815 <em>Missionary Chronicle</em>? It is tempting to read his reference to ‘curiosity’ as an echo of the <em>Chronicle’s</em> language.</p>\n<p>William Ellis, after he had arrived at Tahiti, recorded in his diary for 26 April 1817 that Pomare had been ‘much pleased with the portraits in the Evangelical Magazine, and some prints of Natural History’, so it is not impossible that Pomare would have seen the Missionary Chronicle.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup></p>\n<p>However, a journal of the Tahiti mission records that magazines arrived from England on 29 December 1815, but none dated later than the beginning of January 1814, which makes it unlikely Pomare would have seen the appeal for the new Missionary Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup></p>\n<p>Earlier in the year, however, on 6 May 1815, the Queen Charlotte had arrived at Moorea with letters dated between December 1813 and July 1814. In the Missionary Chronicle of May 1814 a notice had appeared noting the arrival of ‘specimens of idols… especially from China’, which expressed an intention on the part of the Society to exhibit them to their friends:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;not merely to gratify curiosity, but to excite their pity, their prayers, and their exertions in behalf of millions of their fellow-creatures, sitting in the region of the shadow of death.</em> <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n<p>While it is possible Pomare may have seen this, it probably makes most sense to understand Pomare’s despatch of the idols as part of his ongoing attempt to convince the missionaries of the sincerity of his conversion.</p>\n<p>In addition, he clearly wanted to develop a relationship of exchange directly with the centre of missionary power in London, rather than with missionary proxies in Tahiti – his Hawaiian advisor with experience of London presumably gave Pomare an important insight into the real locus of British power.</p>\n<p>Pomare’s strategy was successful, resulting in a correspondence with Rev. Dr. Haweis, initiator of the mission to Tahiti. Writing in October 1818, just after his family idols finally reached London, Pomare thanked Haweis for his letter of August 1817 and the gift of books, as well as an earlier gift of a pocket watch.</p>\n<p>Pomare explained that a local Missionary Society had been established in Tahiti to collect coconut oil, pork, arrow-root and cotton as missionary tribute, informing Haweis that he had decided to name a ship he had built at Tahiti after him. He also stated:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;I have sent you the evil spirits (idols) which you sent to me for. All the large idols are consumed, having been burned in the fire. This is only a little one that remains. The name of the little idol is Taroa.</em><br>\n<br/><em>I also send you two little fans which the Royal Family of these countries were accustomed to fan themselves with. When the day of the festival arrived, and the King was prayed for, those were the fans they used to fan away the flies. This was an established custom among the princes in former times. The name of those fans is Nunaachau. They fastened them to the handle, and this used them to drive away the flies. What am I to do with the little pearl box, which was enclosed in the parcel which you sent me? Had it been directed to me, it would have been right; but there is another name on it, that of the Queen of Lattakkoo; that is the reason I inform you of it. I have sent back the little pearl box to Mr Marsden at Port Jackson, that he may return it to you. If you write to me again I shall be glad. If it be agreeable, send me three books: one very large bible: one good portable one, very small; and one book of geography.</em><br>\n<br/><em>If it be not agreeable, very well, do not think evil of me, dear friend, for the small request that I make in the conclusion of my letter. We are well; and I shall be glad to hear that you are well also.</em><br>\n<br/><em>May you be blessed by Jesus Christ, the true King of Salvation, by whom we must all be saved.</em></p>\n<p><em>POMARE<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup></em></p>\n<p>If Pomare’s ‘Family Idols’ were his response to a divine Gift of Grace, he clearly didn’t anticipate the exchange ending there, and his early requests for guns and powder were now converted into requests for books and knowledge – sending Pomare the books he requested was one of Haweis’ very last acts on earth.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is easy to see how the evangelical theology of Grace, freely given by God though the sacrifice of Christ could be understand in relation to a Polynesian theology of <em>mana</em> – divine and ancestral power – concentrated in <em>to’o</em> and acquired through sacrifice and participation in ceremonies. What need had Pomare for older <em>to’o</em> if he could access <em>mana</em> through the word of God, concentrated in the textual form of the bible and other books?</p>\n<p>As a wave of conversion enveloped Tahiti and the surrounding islands, the need for missionaries and bibles became increasingly urgent. On 13 February 1817, William Ellis finally arrived at Moorea, bringing with him a technology that would prove central to the spread of Christianity across the Pacific – a printing press. On 30 June 1817, Ellis looked on as Pomare printed the very first page of a Tahitian spelling book.</p>\n<p>On 25 August 1819 the Rev. Rowland Hill, a founder and Director of the London Missionary Society addressed a Missionary Festival in Cornwall, gathered at the Independent Chapel in Falmouth. According to a report in the Missionary Chronicle:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;Before the meeting closed the principal idol of Pomare’s family was conveyed round the Chapel by Mr Hill’s servant: its workmanship was admired for the ingenuity it displayed, and while the idol itself excited commiseration for those who still worship such ‘foolish Gods’, thansgivings were offered to Jehovah, that Taheite’s idols are no more!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup></em></p>\n<p>Such confidence that the ‘idols are no more’ seems strange in retrospect, when it marked the very moment they had in fact gone global – forwarded to London, they became a central feature at the missionary museum, and the prototypes for images that circulated around the world in missionary publications.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h3>**Notes</h3>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Memoir of Mrs Mary Ellis, Crocker &amp;

Mr. Ward’s History of the Literature and the Religion of the Hindoos.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A month after their arrival, the cover of Missionary Sketches featured nine of Townley’s models, each with the name of the God they depicted printed beneath.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup><br>\nAbbreviated descriptions of each God, summarising Ward’s text, were given on the following pages. In a footer at the end of the descriptions, a paragraph clarified their intended message, positioning the work of missionaries in India as a direct continuation of a long-term battle against religious idols, documented in both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are specimens, Christian Reader, of the gods of the heathen in India, worshipped by more than a hundred millions of deluded people. These are the creatures of a corrupt imagination, and the workmanship of men’s hands ­­­— “they have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; they have ears, but they hear not; they have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither speak they through their throat. They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusted in them. O Israel, trust thou in the Lord.” Psalm cxv. 5—10.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These conjunctions of artefact, image and text illustrate the strong connections between items sent to the Missionary Museum and the images and texts that appeared in missionary publications. It seems likely that Townley, like John Smith in Demerara, had seen the early issues of Missionary Sketches from 1818, featuring the Trimurti from Elephanta, Mantis the Soothsayer from South Africa, and the Family Idols of Pomare from Tahiti. A fairly recent arrival in India, Townley had been sent to Calcutta by the Missionary Society’s Directors in 1816.</p>\n<p>The Rev. Mr. Ward, on the other hand, was William Ward, something of a veteran with nearly two decades of experience working for Baptist Missionary Society in India. In the aftermath of the French revolution, non-conformist churches in Britain had been associated with political radicalism, and the official line of the East India Company prohibited their missionaries from operating in areas it controlled. Sympathetic Company officials, however, had turned a blind eye to the activities of William Carey, the original Baptist missionary, after he arrived in India in 1793, particularly when he was officially employed on an indigo plantation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>The arrival of William Ward, along with three other Baptist missionaries and their families, in 1799, was harder to ignore. The recently arrived Anglo-Irish Governor-General, Richard Wellesley, pursuing a war against the French and their allies in Mysore, refused them permission to join Carey in Bengal. As a consequence, the Baptists established themselves at Serampore, a Danish controlled town less than twenty miles north of Calcutta, the capital of British India, much to Wellesley’s initial displeasure.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Originally a printer and journalist from Derby in the British Midlands, Ward was responsible for the printing press at Serampore, established in 1800, where translations of the Bible were printed in Bengali, Marathi, Hindi and other Indian languages.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> The project of religious translation involved working closely with Indian scholars such as Ram Ram Basu, who was worked for Carey as his munshi (language teacher).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Governor Wellesley established Fort William College in Calcutta in 1801, it was Carey he appointed to teach Bengali, assisted by Basu. The project of translation operated in multiple directions—Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana were published in Bengali in 1802-03. From 1805 the Baptists were even paid a stipend by the Asiatic Society at Fort William College to translate and publish Sanskrit texts in English<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup></p>\n<p>The first volume of Ward’s Account of the Writings, Religion, and Manners of the Hindoos including Translations from their Principal Works was printed at the Mission Press in Serampore in 1806, with the fourth volume completed in 1811, just before a fire destroyed the print works (Ward 1811). A second edition, “carefully abridged and greatly improved”, was printed between 1815 and 1818 under the title A View of the History, Literature, and Religion of the Hindoos, with a third edition printed in Britain by the Baptist Missionary Society between 1817 and 1820.</p>\n<p>A compendium of Indian religious texts printed in English, alongside descriptions of Hindu practice, Ward provided British evangelicals with an accessible guide to ‘the religion of the Hindoos‘. Even before the arrival in London of Townley’s ‘models’, Ward’s text had been used to compile a description that accompanied an image of Ganesh that was printed in the Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle in March 1818.</p>\n<p>It was noted that many Hindus kept a small metal image of the god in their houses for daily worship. The Evangelical Magazine, however, was not content to adopt a position of straightforward condescension in relation to this ‘idolatry’, noting that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The superstitious regard paid by these blind idolaters to a senseless image, may put to shame many who are better informed, and who call themselves Christians, but who live practically “without God in the world;” who never acknowledge the Creator and Preserver; and who daily go out and return home, amidst a thousand dangers, without seeking his guidance or protection.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The London Missionary Society sent their first missionary to India in 1798. Arriving five years after William Carey, also without an official licence, Nathaniel Forsyth preached in and around Calcutta with the tacit support of Company officials. With minimal financial assistance from the Society in London, he found Calcutta expensive and lived for a time on a boat, until appointed minister of the Dutch church at Chinsurah (Hugli-Chuchura) in West Bengal. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup></p>\n<p>Only in 1804 were further missionaries sent to India by the LMS, but they went to the south. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, the major Indian campaigns undertaken by the Society seem to have been largely conducted through a war of words in London.<br>\nIn July 1806 an uprising at Vellore Fort in Tamil Nadu, South India, following the implementation of new uniform regulations involving the trimming of beards and removal of caste marks, was connected to the circulation of rumours about forced conversion to Christianity. Evangelicals sought to blame the family of Tipu Sultan, imprisoned at the fort, as well as the Madras administration, invoking the weight of British evangelical opinion in an attempt to avert a wholesale recall of missionaries from India. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Making the case for the opposition was the Rev. Sydney Smith, who, in his essay “Indian Missions” published in The Edinburgh Review of February 1808, quoted the Transactions of the Missionary Society at length to illustrate the strong reactions missionary activity provoked in India. Smith argued that it was perilous to proselytise in a precarious India ‘without incurring the utmost risk of losing our empire’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> In the essay, which Smith himself later characterised as ‘routing out a nest of consecrated cobblers’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup>, he famously asked: ‘Why are we to send out little detachments of maniacs to spread over the fine regions of the world the most unjust and contemptible opinion of the gospel?’ <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>Evangelicals were ultimately successful in defending the admittedly fairly ambiguous status quo, but many of the same arguments resurfaced in the years leading up to the British government’s renewal of the East India Company’s charter in 1813.<br>\nEvangelical networks across the British Isles were mobilised in a campaign that led to 908 petitions supporting the promulgation of Christianity in India being submitted to the British parliament, at that time the largest number ever presented. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup>  In a parliamentary compromise orchestrated by William Wilberforce, all sides were enabled to believe they had achieved some of their aims. A new clause in the charter of the East India Company made it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the Duty of this country, to promote the interests and happiness of the native inhabitants of the British dominions in India, and that such measures ought to be adopted as may tend to the introduction among them of useful knowledge, and of religious and moral improvement. That in the furtherance of the above objects, sufficient facilities shall be afforded by law, to persons desirous of going to, and remaining in India, for the purpose of accomplishing those benevolent designs. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the major consequences of this clause was the establishment of schools across India, including for girls, supported financially by the East India Company—the Rev. Robert May of the London Missionary Society established thirty schools, educating nearly 3000 children including 700 sons of Brahmins in and around Chinsurah between 1812 and 1816. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup>   The exterior, interior and plan view of one of these schools was depicted on the cover of Missionary Sketches in October 1820, a year after the cover had featured Townley’s ‘Hindoo Idols’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was in the wake of this campaign and the resulting new clause that Henry Townley had been sent to re-establish the Society’s mission at Calcutta, following the death of Forsyth. The Bengal Auxiliary Missionary Society was established in December 1817 to raise funds locally to support missionary activity. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup> Prompted to contribute to the stock of missionary images, Townley, acting on behalf of the Auxiliary Society either purchased or commissioned a set of twenty-two murti (models)—images of Hindu gods.</p>\n<p>It is significant these were described as “models”. This may have been an attempt to translate the word murti, which carries a sense that such figures take the material form of a god, without being gods in themselves, but it more likely suggests that they were acquired from the craftspeople who made them, rather than from temples or homes, where they had already been the focus for puja or bhakti (religious devotion). Unlike Pomare’s Family Idols, these were not given up by converts to Christianity, but they remained useful in illustrating the religious practices of India for missionary supporters across the world.</p>\n<p>The fact that eight of the murti were arranged on the cover of Missionary Sketches around the black-faced figure of Jugunnathu is significant, reflecting this figure’s centrality to early nineteenth century British imaginations of Indian religion. A note in parentheses in the accompanying written account points out that the name of this God is ‘usually written Juggernaut’, explaining that this name is a title for a deified hero meaning “Lord of the World”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup></p>\n<p>The form of the image, with no legs and only stumps for arms but a very large head and eyes was explained: having been commissioned to house the bones of Krishna, its maker was interrupted at work, leaving the image unfinished. Brahma, himself, however, was said to have given the murti its eyes and a soul.</p>\n<p>The focus of the printed description in Missionary Sketches then shifts from the image itself to the temple to Jagganath in Orissa and its annual Car Festival. As part of this, the crowd drew a tapering tower containing the image of Jagganath, between 50 to 60 feet high and with sixteen wheels. The description ends by noting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unnumbered multitudes of pilgrims, from all parts of India, attend this festival, among whom a great mortality frequently prevails; and hundreds, perhaps thousands of persons, diseased or distressed, have cast themselves under the wheels of this ponderous car, and have been crushed to death. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The subjugation of Orissa during the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803, pursued by Wellesley, placed the temple of Jagannath at Puri, a major site of regional pilgrimage, under the control of the East India Company. The appointment by the Company of a tax collector and committee to manage temple affairs upset evangelicals, who argued that this amounted to state-sponsored idolatry.</p>\n<p>The person most responsible for advancing this concern was Claudius Buchanan, an evangelical Scottish Anglican minister appointed to an East India Company chaplaincy in Bengal in 1796, who became vice-provost of Fort William College in 1800, where he worked closely with William Carey.<br>\nIn 1811 Buchanan published Christian Researches in Asia<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> and in December of that year, the Evangelical Magazine syndicated his description of the festival of Juggernaut in order to ‘kindle the zeal of European Christians in the support and extension of Missionary efforts’ by becoming ‘more intimately acquainted with the horrors of Heathenism’:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have returned home from witnessing a scene which I shall never forget. At twelve o’clock of this day, being the great day of the east, the Moloch of Hindoostan was brought out of his temple, amidst the acclamations of hundreds of thousands of his worshippers […]’<br>\nThe idol is a block of wood, having a frightful visage, painted black, with a distended mouth of a bloody colour […] An aged minister of the idol then stood up; and, with a long rod in his hand, which he moved with indecent action, completed the variety of this disgusting exhibition. I felt a consciousness of doing wrong in witnessing it […] The characteristics of Moloch’s worship are obscenity and blood. We have seen the former. Now comes the blood.<br>\nAfter the tower had proceeded some way, a pilgrim announced that he was ready to offer himself a sacrifice to the idol. He laid himself down in the road before the tower, as it was moving along, lying on his face, with arms stretched forwards. The multitude passed round him, leaving the space clear, and he was crushed to death by the wheels of the tower. A shout of joy was raised to the god. He is said to smile when the libation of the blood is made. The people threw cowries, or small money, on the body of the victim, in approbation of the deed. He was left to view a considerable time, and was then carried by the hurries to the Golgotha, where I have just been viewing his remains. How much I wished that the Proprietors of India Stock could have attended the wheels of Juggernaut, and seen this peculiar source of their revenue!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Buchanan’s reference to Moloch connected Jagannath to the Old Testament book of Leviticus but also to Milton’s Paradise Lost, making it clear he regarded the procession at Puri as a form of demonic idolatry, endorsed and managed by a British commercial company. The image of the immense and unstoppable car of Juggernaut, crushing pilgrims beneath its wheels was so potent that it captured early nineteenth century evangelical opinion, finding an enduring place in the English language.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the years that followed, the front cover of Missionary Sketches featured further Indian gods, with commentary supplied by Ward. In July 1820, an image of “Kalee, the black goddess of India” included a description of the animal sacrifices Ward witnessed at a festival in Calcutta:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Never did I see men so eagerly enter into the shedding of blood; the place literally swam with blood. The bleating of the animals, the numbers slain and the ferocity of the people employed actually made me unwell; and I returned about midnight, filled with horror and indignation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In January 1821, the cover featured a representation of “Doorga, a principal goddess of the Hindoos” based on a drawing made and purchased at Chinsurah along with a number of others, distinctive in that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>all the lines by which the figures are delineated are composed of the name of the idol, in the Bengalee character, many thousand times repeated. The ornaments (here omitted) which are very profuse and not inelegant, are formed in the same manner.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The text described Durga and the features of ceremonies at which she was worshipped, noting a ceremony Ward witnessed at Calcutta in 1806, when:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The whole scene produced on my mind sensations of greatest horror. The dress of the singers – their indecent gestures – the abominable nature of the songs – the horrid din of their miserable drum – the lateness of the hour – the darkness of the place – with the reflection that I was standing in an idol temple, and that this immense multitude of rational and immortal creatures, capable of such superior enjoyments, were, in the very set of worship, perpetrating a crime of high treason against the God of heaven, while they themselves believed they were performing an act of merit.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rumours of human sacrifices to Durga were reported, and a footnote enumerated the far larger number of annual deaths in ways that were, according to Ward, sanctioned by the ‘shasters (religious books of the Hindoos)’, which he had calculated:</p>\n<p>Widows burnt alive on the funeral pile\t5000<br>\nPilgrims perishing on the roads and at sacred places\t4000<br>\nPersons drowning themselves in the Ganges, or buried or burnt alive\t500<br>\nChildren immolated, including the rajpoots  \t500<br>\nSick persons, whose death is hastened on the banks of the Ganges\t500<br>\n10,500</p>\n<p>Although not given a number, the body of the text listed another cause of death: ‘by the wheels of the idol Juggernaut’.</p>\n<p>In April 1822, the cover of Missionary Sketches once again featured an image of Juggernaut, as well as diagrammatic representations of Boloram and Sabattra, his siblings.</p>\n<p>The text included a mythical history of the creation of the three murti, abridged from an account drawn up by a Brahmin from Orissa.</p>\n<p>The commentary that followed listed a number of features of the narrative, each provided with biblical references, suggestive of Christian parallels that might make the bible—referred to as the “True Veda”—appealing to Hindus.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup></p>\n<p>The following issue, printed in July 1822, included an image of the procession of Juggernaut, with the textual description taken from Buchannan’s account, eleven years after it had appeared in the Missionary Chronicle—to lay before readers ‘the horrible enormities and abominable idolatries attending the Festival of the Car‘.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">29</a></sup></p>\n<p>This was juxtaposed with another description by Buchanan of baptism and preaching at Serampore, alongside texts quoted from William Carey and William Ward. Readers were told:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘Surely no reader of this sketch would hesitate to exert himself, or to subscribe a portion of his property, to put a stop only to the evils connected with the IDOL JUGGERNAUT.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">30</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just as Townley’s models were followed on the cover of Missionary Sketches by an image of a Chapel and school at Madras in January 1820, the succeeding issue, printed in October 1822, depicted Union Chapel in Calcutta, opened in April 1821. A centre for missionary activity, it was also intended to make evangelical Christianity available to the many dissolute Europeans living what evangelicals regarded as immoral lives in the capital of British India.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup></p>\n<p>Readers were provided with a history of the city, including an account of English prisoners dying crowded into the Black Hole Prison in 1756. This was followed by an account of the Serampore translations by the Baptist Missionaries, the work of Forsyth, as well as the arrival of Townley and more recent missionaries in the city.</p>\n<p>The London Missionary Society’s grant of 1000 Rupees a year to support the School Society was noted, with the implication that schools and chapels would rapidly replace temples of idol worship across India.</p>\n<p>While the missionary critique of India and its religious institutions was frequently harsh and intemperate, it is striking that it seems to have induced a response from Indian intellectuals.</p>\n<p>Ram Ram Basu, who worked with Carey from the 1790s onwards and never converted to Christianity, nevertheless argued for the reform of Hinduism based on the Vedas. He even wrote a Bengali text about Jesus Christ, Christabibaranamrta, in 1803.</p>\n<p>In 1817, Mrityunjaya Vidyalankar, an orthodox Brahmin depicted working alongside William Carey on translations at Fort William College compiled a legal report suggesting that the practice of sati (widow burning) was not sanctioned by any Indian holy texts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">32</a></sup></p>\n<p>Most famously, Rammohum Roy, who worked alongside Basu, Vidyalankar and Carey at Fort William College spearheaded a movement to reform Hinduism, the principal targets of which were shared with evangelical missionaries:  idolatry, the caste system and sati. Sometimes remembered as the “father of the Bengal Renaissance”, Roy was significantly influenced by his engagement with Christianity, publishing The Precepts of Jesus, the Guide to Peace and Happiness in 1820, setting out ethical teachings drawn from the gospels.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fnref33\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">33</a></sup></p>\n<p>Criticised by some Baptist missionaries for extracting the teaching of Jesus from their framing within a narrative of salvation by grace, premised on Christ’s sacrifice on the cross, Roy continued working on a revised translation of the New Testament with the Baptist Missionary William Adam, only for Adam to leave the Baptists to establish a Unitarian Society in Calcutta with Roy.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fnref34\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">34</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Catalogue of the Missionary Museum, printed in 1826,35 begins its East Indies section with Case H, containing twenty-one named and numbered ‘Indian idols’. The nine murti depicted in October 1819 are all listed, in many cases alongside descriptions taken directly from the text of Missionary Sketches. In addition to these nine, the following were included in the same list, albeit without the same degree of further description:</p>\n<p>CHOITUNYU, THE WISE\tSHIVU LINGU<br>\nUBHUYA\tRADHA<br>\nLU RUHMUNU\tVISWAKARMA<br>\nNUNDEE\tBULURAMU<br>\nKARTIKEYU\tBRUMHA<br>\nJUGUDDHATREE\tLUKSHMEE</p>\n<p>The original note in the Missionary Chronicle of September 1819 referred to ‘twenty-two models of Hindoo deities’. In the seven years between their arrival and the publication of the catalogue, one seems to have been lost or broken.</p>\n<p>Although they appear in nineteenth century images, such as that depicting the case ‘Indian Idols’ at the Missionary Museum, published in 1860, I haven’t been able to locate any of the original twenty-two models, two centuries after they arrived in London.</p>\n<p>The closest I have come is a somewhat damaged painted clay figure of Jagganath held by the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford (1910.62.84). Made from clay rather than wood, it has a different, less waisted, shape to the image located at the centre of the cover of Missionary Sketches in October 1819.</p>\n<p>It therefore seems more likelyto be one of the numerous other representations of Jagganath associated with the London Missionary Society, including some that found their way into a case chiefly featuring images of the Buddha in 1860.</p>\n<p>The Pitt Rivers Museum Jagganath appears to best match a black and white photograph, published in 1899 that includes a miniature model of Jagganath’s car.</p>\n<p>Juggernaut—’the Moloch of Hindoostan’— clearly continued to haunt both missionary imagery and missionary imaginations until the very end of the nineteenth century.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>‘India’, Missionary Chronicle for September 1819, p. 385, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y_gDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA385#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y_gDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA385#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> [retrieved 5.07.22]. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>‘HINDOO IDOLS’, Missionary Sketches, No. VII, October 1819, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/missionarysketch00lond/page/n24/mode/1up\" target=\"_blank\">https://archive.org/details/missionarysketch00lond/page/n24/mode/1up</a> [retrieved 5.07.22]. <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>‘HINDOO IDOLS’, Missionary Sketches, No. VII, October 1819, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/missionarysketch00lond/page/n25/mode/1up\" target=\"_blank\">https://archive.org/details/missionarysketch00lond/page/n25/mode/1up</a> [retrieved 5.07.22]. <a href=\"#fnref3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Carson, Penelope. 2012.

Built atPort Jackson, she was a 70 ton copper bottomed schooner equipped with six guns.After 1811, during the mental illness of King George III, Britain was ruled byhis son as Prince Regent, hence the vessel’s name. In January 1820 George IIIpassed away, eight months after Kamehameha I, the King of Hawai’i.</p>\n<p>Like his near contemporaries, Pomare in Tahiti and Napoleonin Europe, Kamehameha pursued a strategy of military expansion. During hisreign he established a united kingdom across the Hawai’ian Islands usingEuropean weapons, with strategic input from his British advisors, John Youngand Isaac Davies.  George III’s reign had seen the political union ofthe kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, but also the loss of thecolonies that became the United States of America.</p>\n<p>It is perhaps unsurprising that as ruler of an islandkingdom, Kamehameha preferred to pursue an alliance with the British, ratherthan the Republican and continental USA. Ultimately, the Prince Regent, as agift, would link the succeeding generation of island kings, George IV,previously the Prince Regent, and Kamehameha II, also known as Liholiho. Whenthe twenty-one year old assumed the throne, however, he had been greeted byQueen Ka’ahumanu, wearing his father’s royal robe. She declared she would rule alongsidehim as <em>Kuhina Nui</em> or Queen Regent.</p>\n<p>In November 1819, at a feast to commemorate Kamehameha I,Liholiho sat down and ate with the royal women, inaugurating the end of theexisting <em>kapu</em> (taboo) system – a period now referred to inHawai’ian as the ‘<em>Ai Noa</em> (free eating). It seems likely that thisaction was at least partly inspired by the actions of Pomare II in Tahitiduring 1815, since both Liholiho and Ka’ahumanu were aware of what had happenedthere.</p>\n<p>At the end of March 1822, however, it was not the Prince Regent that the Mermaid brought to Kealakekua Bay, having lost sight of hercharge on their way across the Pacific, but rather a party of twelvemissionaries. En route to Hawai’i from Australia, the two vessels had stoppedat Huahine, near Tahiti, where Captain Kent of the Mermaid had been persuadedto make space for them on board.</p>\n<p>Having established the missionary printing press at Mooreain June 1817, William Ellis oversaw the printing of 7000 Tahitian school booksduring the first five months of its operation, working seven or eight hours aday. Writing home on 4 December 1817, he noted:</p>\n<p>Canoes are frequently arriving from various parts, withpersons whose business is to enquire when the books will be ready: and anincreasing desire to become acquainted with the word of God, powerfullypervades the minds of the people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>A 24 page translation of the Gospel of Luke was soonprepared for printing, with paper supplied by the British and Foreign BibleSociety.</p>\n<p>In mid-November 1817, six additional British missionariesarrived at Tahiti, including Lancelot Threlkeld, who had left England with Ellis but was held up in Rio de Janeiro due to the illness of his family. Alsoamong the new recruits was John Williams, who would become a celebratedmissionary martyr decades later.</p>\n<p>In May 1818, the time that LMS supporters gatheredannually for missionary week in London, Pomare II established a Tahitian Auxiliary Missionary Society to collect donations of coconut oil, pigs,arrowroot and cotton to enable the expansion of missionary work beyond Tahiti.</p>\n<p>In early July of that year, with the Gospel of Luke printedin Tahitian and bound copies distributed among the missionaries, Ellis loadedthe printing press onto the <em>Haweis,</em> a locally built missionaryship, and sailed for the island of Huahine. He was initially accompanied by Williams and Threlkeld, but in September the pair relocated to the neighbouringisland of Raiatea, a Polynesian ceremonial centre widely recognised across the Pacific.</p>\n<p>By 1822, the Church at Huahine was well established andintent on sending its own missionaries to resume the aborted mission to theMarquesas Islands, a thousand miles to the north-east. A religious meeting ofaround 1200 people in the island’s large chapel selected two volunteers. Auna,a nobleman and former priest of Raiatea, now a deacon of the Huahine church,volunteered to take the ‘good word of God’ – <em>parau maitai nate atua</em> –together with his wife, who the congregation agreed would teach the women ‘tomake their own dresses, plat straw bonnets’ in order ‘to clothe themselves decently’.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> The assembly thencalled on Mattatore, another nobleman, to accompany them, together with his wife.</p>\n<p>Captain Kent of the Mermaid agreed to provide the volunteerswith free passage, either on his way to Hawai’i or on the return voyage. Auna,Mattatore and their wives were accompanied by William Ellis, as well as DanielTyerman and George Bennet, who were visiting Huahine at the time, together withtheir ‘personal servants’, engaged at Huahine (including one named Purahah).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tyerman, a minister from the Isle of Wight, and Bennet, alay supporter of missions from Sheffield in Yorkshire, were known as ‘theDeputation’ – sent by their fellow Directors of the London Missionary Societyon a journey of inspection around the globe:</p>\n<p>to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the state ofthe missions, and of the islands; and to suggest, and, if possible, carry intoeffect, such plans as shall appear to be requisite for the furtherance of thegospel, and for introducing among the natives the occupations and habits ofcivilised life.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Directors were apparently more concerned with ‘theoccupations and habits of civilised life’ than many of the missionaries. A fewyears earlier they had sent John Gyles with equipment for processing sugar caneto Tahiti – he had previously been an overseer in Jamaica. According to amissionary account compiled at Tahiti:</p>\n<p>Both Mr G and the Directors of the Missionary Societyappeared to have wrong views on the subject, They thought as the people hadembraced Christianity, they would at once see the propriety of productive plansof industry that might be proposed to them and at once adopt all that might beproposed advantageous from the circumstances of climate &amp;c such as theCulture of the sugar Cane, Cotton, Coffee &amp;c and Mr G having been in theWest Indies, and witnessing the cheapness of labour by means of negroes thoughtthe natives of these islands might be induced to labour in the same way. But hesoon found he had free and independent people to deal with, and the more ofcommand and authority he used toward them, the less they were disposed to obey.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In August 1819, after an unsuccessful and ultimatelyunproductive year, Gyles left with his family for Australia. Undeterred, in May1821, the Directors despatched two further missionary artisans and theirfamilies to Tahiti along with Tyerman, Bennet and another missionary recruitwith all the equipment for spinning and weaving cotton in a British whalingship. As well as a crew of 35 and a surgeon, the passengers also included a 25year old Tahitian who had been baptised with the name Robert.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Arriving at Matavai Bay in late September 1821, theDeputation began an engagement with the Society’s mission stations that wouldlast until Bennet finally returned to Britain in June 1829. The visit toHawai’i was unplanned, but provided an opportunity to meet the missionaries whohad arrived there in March 1820, sent by the USA’s counterpart to the LMS, theAmerican Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, established in 1810.</p>\n<p>Unlike the British first edition of the <em>Journal ofVoyages and Travels by the Rev. Daniel Tyerman and George Bennet, Esq,</em> publishedin two volumes 1831, an American version, published in Boston the followingyear, ends the first of three volumes with their arrival atKealekekua Bay on 31 March 1822. Revised by an American Editor, this choiceseems deliberate – beginning the second volume with the deputation’s time in Hawai’i – of greatest interest to a New England readership.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>After leaving Huahine, north-easterly winds saw the Mermaidbypass the Marquesas. Her crew and passengers were no less cosmopolitan thanthe fictional whaling ship Pequod, immortalised in Herman Melville’s 1851novel <em>Moby Dick</em>. When an orphaned Australian aboriginal boy felloverboard, he was saved by Tyerman and Bennet’s Tahitian attendants, who divedinto the sea, a rope tied around their waists – a feat that was performed byQueequeg, the Polynesian harpooner of Melville’s whaling tale.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The first Hawai’ian to meet the party at Kawaihae Bay wasJohn Adams Kuakini, Royal Governor of Hawai’i, the largest island in thearchipelago, and younger brother of the Queen Regent Ka’ahumanu. Kuakini, whohad learned English from Americans visitors and adopted the name of the second American President was dressed in a jacket and trousers.</p>\n<p>The following day, the Mermaid was visited by a number ofmore ordinary Hawai’ians in canoes, described by Tyerman and Bennet as ‘veryscantily attired, and very slovenly in their manners’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> When the deputation went ashore the following day, they encountered women wearing’no covering except a slight cloth about their loins’ but some were ‘superblytattooed’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Later, they met a high status woman with ‘remarkably modest’demeanour, wearing ‘a scarlet woollen under-dress of European manufacture, andan upper robe of fine native-cloth’, set off with a necklace of black beadsfrom which a whale’s tooth ornament was suspended, while ‘over her bosom, also,was slung a small looking-glass’ by a slip of brown list.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Others,such as a priest wearing an English shirt, were regarded as ‘preposterous’.</p>\n<p>Visiting the house of a chief, Tyerman and Bennet weresurprised to find a print hanging on the wall showing a Hawai’ian man and womantaken from the 1784 published account of Cook’s third voyage. The man depictedwas Kana’ina, also known as Kalaimanokaho’owaha, a chief who was killedalongside with Cook, while the woman was his wife Poeta, presumably relativesif not ancestors of the householder.</p>\n<p>Writing in their journal, the deputation couldn’t helpcomparing what they encountered at Kawaihae Bay to the situation in the SocietyIslands, where they have spent most of the previous six months:</p>\n<p>Here, where the gospel as yet has done but little in itsspiritual effects, we were taught to estimate, more truly than we could evenupon the spot, how much it has done in the Society Islands. The contrast waspowerful, and it was saddening; yet not without hope.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tyerman and Bennet were not the only ones scandalised by the‘disgusting scantiness’ of ordinary female Hawai’ian dress, it seems. WhenHawaiian women visited the Mermaid after it had anchored at Kealekekua Bay andadmired the bonnets and dresses of the female Tahitians, according to thedeputation’s journal, the Tahitians:</p>\n<p>took the opportunity frankly to reprove them for appearingwith so little clothing on; assuring them that in the southern islands, nomodest woman durst go out of doors so unbecomingly exposed. They added,moreover, “and we will not acknowledge you to be women if you do not dress moredecently.” The dialects of the both nations are so nearly akin that the nativescan converse very well with one another.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Landing at Kealekekua Bay, Tyerman and Bennet were struck bythe large <em>marae</em> _(_ceremonial enclosure), where twotwelve foot high carved posts still stood on the stone walls at the north-eastside, ‘across the middle of each of which something to resemble a human facehas been carved, of monstrous size and uncouth features’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>John Young, long-time British advisor to Kamehameha I,provided an eyewitness account of Liholiho’s overturning of <em>kapu</em>,but told them that the majority of god figures made from wood and stone hadbeen hidden rather than destroyed, with many people awaiting the restoration ofthe former system.</p>\n<p>The deputation noted that unlike their time in the SocietyIslands, they were not offered a single religious idol for sale.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Theywere, however, allowed to take a large carving representing the God ofwar <em>Ku-ka’ili</em> from the ancient <em>marae</em> by JohnAdams Kuakini, later prominently displayed in the LMS museum and now at theBritish Museum.</p>\n<p>When dining with Kuakini and Young, it was proposed thatWilliam Ellis be pronounced <em>kapu</em> so that he would have to stayon the island, his ability to speak Tahitian making him more useful than theAmerican missionaries.</p>\n<p>Conversion seems to have meant different things to differentpeople. In most cases change was expressed through the adoption, but at timesalso the construction, of new kinds of artefacts. Kamehameha I evidently wanteda ship, complete with guns, to make him the equal of the European leaders whohad visited the islands since the time of Captain Cook. John Adams Kuakiniadopted modern dress and took an American name, just as other high statusHawaiians wore items of imported clothing.</p>\n<p>Converted women from the Society Islands, however,emphasised respectability over novelty in dress, as well as their own capacityto make dresses and bonnets to clothe themselves. It is likely that the dressesthey referred to were <em>tiputa</em>, ponchos made locally from bark cloththat covered the upper part of the body and became widely associated withconversion to Christianity across the Pacific.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Directors of the London Missionary Society, however,were chiefly concerned with modern forms of work and productivity. Themanufacturing processes of the the sugar plantation and cotton mill expressedwhat Max Weber would later call the <em>The Protestant Work Ethic</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> inmaterial form, but as committed abolitionists, they believed wage labour shouldultimately replace the forced labour of enslaved people as the productive forceon which so much commodity production depended.</p>\n<p>For European missionaries, perhaps unsurprisingly, a centralmarker of conversion was support for and ultimately adoption of missionaryactivity by the converted. The collection and donation of gifts to supportmissionary work, as well as the construction of chapels where missionarymeetings could be held, were seen to demonstrate the evangelical orientationsof Christian converts.</p>\n<p>Auna, as a deacon of the church at Huahine, whenvolunteering to become a missionary himself, spoke of the ‘good word of god’. It seems that for many Pacific islanders this was represented by the writtenword, but perhaps more precisely the printed word – Polynesian words convertedto marks that were impressed onto paper by the mission printing press.</p>\n<p>While the press was a mechanical device – like a sugarpress, or cotton mill – through which labour was transformed into new kinds ofartefacts, the attitude Polynesians took towards the paper on which the pressimprinted the word of god does not seem to have been immaterial to theimportance they afforded to books, and to the Bible as the word of god inparticular.</p>\n<p>For Europeans such as Tyerman and Bennet, it was natural tothink of the items they saw Polynesians wearing as made from native cloth, butthe <em>tapa</em> of the Tahitians and <em>kapa</em> of theHawai’ians was not cloth in a typical European sense. Rather than being wovenon a loom from fibre strands that form a warp and a weft, it is formed frombark fibres beaten to make them flat and flexible.</p>\n<p>In its material form, bark cloth with its interlockingstrands of horizontally oriented fibres, is rather more like paper than a woventextile. In Tahiti, high quality <em>tapa</em> was commonly bleachedwhite, with patterns printed onto it to enhance its appearance. In Hawai’i, theprocess of printing patterns onto bark cloth was called <em>palapala</em>, aword that would be extended, first to the printing of words onto paper, andlater to new forms of education in general.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>We might dismiss the concerns of European missionaries with‘scantily clad’ Hawaiians as a consequence of puritanical sexual morality, butwe shouldn’t dismiss the material connection between conversion, new ways ofcovering the body and the widespread circulation of printed texts. There is aPolynesian logic by which clothes elevate and enhance the bodies of theirwearers, making it unsurprising that at <em>Kealakekua Bay</em> it wasthe nobles or <em>ali’i</em> of Hawai’i who were wearing rather moreabout their bodies.</p>\n<p>This concern with wrapping and marking the body, alsoexpressed through tattooing, aligns in certain ways with missionarypreoccupations with dress as an indicator of modesty and respectability. Themarking of status and rank through forms of dress was common to both Atlanticand Pacific societies, and it seems that clothing, cloth but also paper formeda zone of recognition where common values could be negotiated and established.</p>\n<p>On 11 April 1822, the Mermaid sailed from Kealekekua Bay toOahu in the hope of locating the Prince Regent. Bennet and Tyerman accompaniedCaptain Kent when he was presented to the King, Kamehameha II, who was pleasedto learn of his gift, mainly, it seems, because it promised to cement apolitical allegiance with the British monarchy – he already had ten other shipsby this time.</p>\n<p>The young king, when first encountered, was wearing a shirt,jacket, waistcoat and pantaloons, accompanied by five wives who were wearingsilken girdles with necklaces of flowers and fern wreaths on their heads. Theassembled party toasted the King’s health with European wine, but Tyerman andBennet couldn’t help noticing the attendant who fanned him continuously withlong white feathers, while one of his wives occasionally proffered a woodendish for the king to spit into.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup></p>\n<p>Captain Kent was given accommodation by the King, butTyerman, Bennet and Ellis were welcomed by the American Missionaries. ATahitian attendant of Queen Regent Ka’ahumanu arrived to ask that his fellowcountrymen be allowed to stay with the Kuhina Nui’s household. It turned outthat he was actually the brother of Auna’s wife, who had left Tahiti as a boy,thirty years previously. Auna and his wife were adopted into this extremelypowerful Hawai’ian household, instituting morning and evening prayers and teachingtheir companions about the new religion.</p>\n<p>Ellis found that his Tahitian enabled him to to make himselfunderstood, and when he preached in the language at the American chapel, thesermon was attended by an array of Hawai’ian nobles, Liholiho seated at theircentre. Tyerman and Bennet compared the event to the preaching of Paul to theAthenians, recorded in the Acts of the Apostles.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>They noted, however, that it was the appearance, dress andconversation of the Tahitian Christians that most impressed the assembled Hawai’ians. Ka’ahumanu evidently spent a great deal of time in conversationwith Auna’s wife about Tahitian politics and the changes brought by the newreligion, while the Tahitian women used their sewing skills to make new clothesfor the Queen Regent. Auna spent a good deal of his time instructing herhusband, Kaumuali’i, King of the island of Kaua’i (marked Tauai on the mapabove).</p>\n<p>From their base at Honolulu, Tyerman and Bennet observed theroyal trade in sandalwood, which saw this locally plentiful commodity traded toChina in American ships. Witnessing two thousand people carrying a vast load tothe coast, they suggested that the condition of the common people of Hawai’iwas akin to slavery – ‘they hold nothing which may not be taken from them bythe strong hand of arbitrary power’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Elsewhere they marvelled at the surf boards, <em>papahorua,</em> in people’s homes, ‘eight or ten feet long, wider at one endthan the other, and convex on both sides’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> They also met aSpaniard who had lived on the island for thirty years, as well as a BlackAmerican consulted for his healing skills by Hawaiians as well as visitingsailors.</p>\n<p>Allen, as he was called, had established a compound forhimself near Waikiki with a flock of two hundred goats that he sold to visitingships, a large number of dogs that he sold to Hawaiians for feasts, as well asa profitable business selling liquor. While Tyerman and Bennet rejoiced in theprosperity of this ‘poor African’, they nevertheless disapproved of hisactivities, particularly since selling alcohol was most profitable on Sundays,when sailors were allowed ashore.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 1 May, <em>the Prince Regent</em> was formallypresented to the King, but when Captain Kent prepared to lower the Britishcolours, Liholiho said he would continue to fly them – perhaps suggesting anorigins for the Hawai’ian flag. Having spent a month in the Sandwich Isles, themissionaries expected to resume their journey to the Marquesas in <em>theMermaid</em>, but were informed by Captain Kent that he would sail to FanningIsland (Tauaeran) to buy <em>béche de mer</em> to sell in China, butwould return later to collect them.</p>\n<p>Finding themselves at a loose end in Honolulu, Tyerman andBennet attempted to persuade the King to formally adopt Christianity. Visitingthe royal women, they found them dressed in a mixture of European and Hawaiianclothing, some wearing silk and calico gowns with feather tippets, while otherswore scarlet cloth about their loins with necklaces made from platted humanhair and whale’s tooth pendants.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>Extremelyvaluable, one of these was later presented to the Missionary Museum by William Ellis.</p>\n<p>Tyerman and Bennet were told that Liholiho’s decision tooverturn the existing religious system had been partly prompted by the reportsof Hawai’ians returning from Britain, America and Australia, where their godswere not worshipped. When Hawai’ian priests stated that abandoning the <em>maraes</em> wouldprevent the rain from falling, Joseph Banks, a young man named after CaptainCook’s companion, pointed out to that there was plenty of rain in England andAmerica, as there was in Tahiti after Pomare destroyed the idols.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Other ‘modernists’ such as John Adams Kuakini found thatdespite offering 40 sacrificial pigs  when directed to do so bypriests, he did not recover from his illness. Even Kamehameha I, towards theend of his reign, evidently refused to cast a large herd of pigs into the seato appease the angry spirit that the priests told him was responsible forvolcanic eruptions on Hawai’i.</p>\n<p>On 10 May, Auna approached Tyerman and Bennet with a requestfrom Ka’ahumanu – that the Tahitians be allowed to stay at Hawai’i, withWilliam Ellis as their overseeing missionary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Thisled Tyerman and Bennet to interpret their prolonged stay in Hawai’i as an actof divine intervention and this request was agreed by Ellis, the AmericanMissionaries, as well as by Liholiho, who like Pomare in Tahiti asked that hebe the first in his kingdom to be instructed in the new religion.</p>\n<p>Waiting for the return of the Mermaid, Tyerman and Bennettoured the island of Oahu where they witnessed four noblewomen printing flowersand ornamental figures onto <em>kapa</em> cloth, using designs engravedonto thin pieces of bamboo:</p>\n<p>This work is executed with considerable expedition as wellas accuracy; and, if not borrowed from the suggestions of European visitors(which is hardly probable), it may be said that <em>printing</em>, as wellas <em>engraving</em>, are original inventions of the Sandwich islanders,both being used in this ingenious process.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis seems to have largely spent this time improving hisHawai’ian – by August he had composed four hymns in the language and was usingit to preach two or three times a week.</p>\n<p>Auna on the other hand, was immediately taken on a tour ofthe islands by Ka’ahumanu. His journal, translated by Ellis, suggests that by 12 May he was at Lahaina on Maui, where the Queen Regent was presented withover 50 bundles of kapa cloth, as well as large quantities of dogs and poi forfeasting. On 17 May, they sailed to tour Hawai’i, Auna preaching each day.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 4 June, Ka’ahumanu sent for one of Kamehameha I’s‘idols’, named ‘<em>Teraipahoa’,</em> which together with 9 smaller idolswere publicly burnt. During the morning of 24 June, following a day spentsurfing and praying, a man fetched eight ‘idols’ named <em>Teraipahoa,Tetonemotu, Paparahaamau, Hatuahia, Kaunaruura, Maiora</em> and <em>Akuahanai.</em> Thesewere supposed to be taken to Liholiho in Oahu, but were instead burnt.</p>\n<p>On 26 June, John Adams Kuakini kindled a major fire in whichhe burnt 102 ‘idols’. According to Auna’s journal, this made him think of theburnings initiated at Papetoai on Moorea by the priest Patii, ‘and with myheart I praised Jehovah, the true God, that I now saw these people followingour example’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> It is surelysignifiant that just as at Tahiti, European missionaries were not involved whenthese acts of iconoclasm took place.</p>\n<p>Back in Oahu, Liholiho told Tyerman and Bennet that heintended to learn the new <em>palapala</em>, and began learning theHawai’ian hymns composed by Ellis. Soon afterwards, however, he wasdisapprovingly noted to be spending the day drinking and dancing the hula.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 29 July, the Mermaid finally returned to Oahu, but ratherthan preparing to leave for Huahine, Auna and his wife left soon afterwards ona tour of the archipelago’s leeward islands with Ka’ahumanu and a retinue of1200 people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tyerman, Bennet, Ellis, Matatore and his wife left Honoluluin the Mermaid on 22 August 1822. After a difficult voyage, they landed at theisland of Rurutu in late September, 350 miles south of Huahine. Approaching theisland they made out ‘neat-looking white houses, built in the English fashion’(493) and on landing they found two Raiatean missionaries, Mahamene and Puna,overseeing the construction of a chapel.⁠35 Their mission tothe island had commenced in July the previous year, the first undertakenwithout European oversight. Attending a service at which Ellis preached, theyfound the balustrade of the pulpit staircase had been made from discardedspears.</p>\n<p>The Mermaid finally returned to Huahine in early October,much to the relief of Ellis’ family, who had become convinced in the 8 monthshe had been away that he had died at the hands of pirates – a ship of whom hadfound their way to Huahine in his absence.</p>\n<p>Having witnessed the effectiveness of Auna’s work inHawai’i, as well as of Mahamene and Puna at Rurutu, Tyerman and Bennet wereconvinced of the need to establish a seminary to educate Polynesians toundertake missionary work. A meeting of missionaries was called on the islandof Raiatea to discuss this, as well as the proposed removal of Ellis and hisfamily to Hawai’i.</p>\n<p>Taking a walk at the end of the day, Tyerman and Bennetnoted ‘increasing evidences of enterprise and industry, of peace and plenty, ofsocial order and religious principle.’ A key observation seems to have beenthat the island’s women were seen wearing bonnets on which there were ‘bows ofribbon, of different tints and curious patterns, some of which were exceedinglyrich’. Asked how they had acquired these impressive items, they were told theyhad been made from bark cloth, inspired by a ribbon awarded to a girl at amissionary school.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">36</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 31 December 1822, Ellis left for Hawai’i with his familyand additional missionary recruits – Taua and his family, as well as Taamotu, afemale teacher.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Arriving inHonolulu on 5 February 1823, they rejoined Auna and the American missionariesin their efforts to complete the conversion of the Hawai’ian archipelago. Taua,together with his family were adopted into the household of Keōpūolani, the motherof Liholiho, in the way that Auna had been by Ka’ahumanu.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In April of the same year, a second company of Americanmissionaries arrived at Honolulu, and in July William Ellis joined AsaThurston, one of the leaders of the first company of missionaries, as well asnew arrivals the Artemas Bishop and Joseph Goodrich, to tour the island ofHawai’i to find suitable locations for additional mission stations.</p>\n<p>Fascinated by the island’s active volcanic geology, theyclimbed to the summit of the volcano Kīlauea, to the consternation of theirguide, Makoa, a King’s messenger.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> At Waiakea theywere confronted by a priestess of the goddess of the volcano, Pélé, but to thesurprise of the missionaries she was challenged by Makoa who told her she waslittle more than a source of mischief. Returning to Kailua Bay, they witnessedJohn Adams Kuakini building a large chapel with stones taken from the old <em>marae</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Returning home to Honolulu on 10 September, Ellis found thechapel had been burned down, presumably as an act of protest at the changesChristianity was bringing to the islands. He was soon summoned to Lahaina, tothe deathbed of Keōpūolani, mother of Liholiho. Conducting the service inHawai’ian, he baptised the Queen the day before she died, making her the firstHawai’ian noble to receive the Christian rite. Keōpūolani evidently asked for aChristian burial. A sketch which was subsequently made into a print thatfeatured on the cover of <em>Missionary Sketches.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fnref41\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">41</a></sup></em></p>\n<p>The accompanying text describes the Queen’s closerelationship with Taua from Huahine, whom she consulted when confronted bychiefs who pointed out that while reading and writing were good things, thepeople of India did these ‘yet they keep their gods of wood and stone just asthey always did’.⁠F</p>\n<p>In November 1823, Kamehameha II decided to visit the BritishIsles himself, commissioning a British whaling ship, L’Aigle, to take them toLondon. Its captain, a young American by the name of Valentine Starbuck agreedto take Liholiho and a party of 10 Hawai’ian nobles, but refused to take William Ellis as their translator and guide.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Stopping at Riode Janeiro, Kamehameha II met Emperor Pedro I of Brazil who he gave a feathercloak or <em>‘ahu ‘ula</em>, receiving a diamond-encrusted sword in return.</p>\n<p>Arriving in England in May 1824, the party waited a month tosee George IV. They were shown the sites of London, attending the opera inCovent Garden and the Theatre Royal, but Liholiho refused to enter WestminsterAbbey lest he desecrate the royal burial place. A number of the Hawai’iansunfortunately contracted the measles and Queen Kamāmalu sadly died in London on8 July 1824, followed by King Kamehameha II six days later.</p>\n<p>In October 1824, <em>Missionary Sketches</em> providedreaders with a ‘Sketch of the Mission to the Sandwich Islands’ featuring adepiction of Auna’s residence but ending with the proposed return of the royalremains, accompanied by a missionary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Back in Hawai’i, the ongoing illness of Mary Ellis made thefamily’s return to England increasingly urgent. In September 1824 they wereoffered passage on an American whaler to New England. Arriving at New Bedfordin March 1825, William Ellis spent four months speaking to Americancongregations from a base in Boston.</p>\n<p>It is presumably for this reason that versions of Ellis’drawings find their way into two volumes published in Boston in that year. Thefirst is a <em>Memoir of Keopuolani, Late Queen of the Sandwich Islands</em>,published in June, which features two images that contrast a scene of Hawai’ian‘wailing’ on the arrival of Kuakini with the Christian burial subsequentlyconducted for the Queen.</p>\n<p>The second volume was <em>A Journal of a Tour AroundHawaii, the largest of the Sandwich Islands</em>, the text of which was compiledby William Ellis. This included portraits of Kuakini (featured above), Makoa aswell as depictions of the royal burial site, a missionary preaching, as well asthe volcanic crater at Kirauea.</p>\n<p>Eventually sailing from New York in late July, the Ellisfamily arrived in England in August 1825, three months after the remains ofLiholiho and his queen had returned to Hawai’i. With nine years missionaryexperience in the Pacific, William Ellis became extremely valuable to theLondon Missionary Society, who immediately sent him to speak at missionarymeetings across the British Isles.</p>\n<p>His testimony was soon converted from the spoken into thewritten word, and early in 1826 his <em>Narrative of a Tour through Hawaii,or Owhyhee; with remakes on the History, Traditions, Manner, Customs, andLanguage of the Inhabitants of the Sandwich Islands,</em> an expandedversion of text published in Boston the previous year was published in London,featuring seven plates made from drawings Ellis had ‘sketched on the spot’,some clearly the same as those featured in the American version.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As a missionary account, the publication of Ellis’ <em>Narrative</em> followedthat of the voyage of the Duff (1799) as well as the two accounts of Africanjourneys by John Campbell (1815 &amp; 1822). Ellis, however, had been a muchlonger-term resident in the places he wrote about. Beginning his account with aconsideration of the narrative of Captain Cook’s third voyage, with whichHawai’i was indissolubly connected in the English mind, he suggested this hadled many readers to imagine the islands were:</p>\n<p>a sort of elysium, where the highly-favoured inhabitants,free from the toil and care, the want and disappointments, which mar thehappiness of civilised communities, dwelt in what they called a state ofnature, and spent their lives in unrestrained gratification and enjoyment.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fnref45\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">45</a></sup></p>\n<p>While these accounts may have been ‘faithful transcripts ofthe first impressions’ made on the minds of Cook and his companions, Ellissuggested they were correct only ‘so far as their partial observationextended’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He argued thatthe arrival of ships and foreigners had been so important and surprising anevent that ordinary life was for a time suspended – the whole island beingdedicated to supplying the every need of the visiting sailors.</p>\n<p>Ellis suggested that the acquaintance of the previousgeneration with the islands and their people had ultimately been superficial incomparison to the eight years he had spent living in the Pacific, leading theminto mistaken inferences. Far different, he suggested were the impressionsproduced on the minds of the missionaries who have resided for some years inthe islands, acquired the language and observed nearly all aspects of life,government and religion.</p>\n<p>Nearly a century before the publication ofMalinowski’s <em>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</em>, William Ellis usedthe length of his stay and his linguistic abilities to establish his literaryauthority as an observer of Pacific life. He also used images, as well asartefacts, acquired during his travels, to buttress the text. Ellis usedfootnotes to refer the reader to specimens of lava and rocks (1826: 228), aswell as:</p>\n<p>Specimens of the principal kinds of native cloth,manufactured in the Sandwich Islands, may be seen in the Missionary Museum,Austin Friars.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While the published accounts of Tyerman, Bennet and Ellissuggest Hawai’ians were actively and enthusiastically acquiring, as well asemulating modern forms of clothing in the early 1820s, these visitors wereclearly equally fascinated by the bark cloth produced in the islands,collecting examples to take to take home to Europe.</p>\n<p>The footnote, cited above, from which this chapter takes itstitle, comes at the end of a fairly extended description of bark clothmanufacture that Ellis incorporated into his account of the 1823 tour ofHawai’i. Having seen people carrying bundles of branches of <em>wauke</em> (papermulberry or Broussoneia papyrifera), six to ten feet long and an inch indiameter, the missionaries watched on the morning of 17 July 1823 as Keoua, thewife of John Adams Kuakini, worked these with her attendants and about 40 otherwomen in the shade of a grove of trees:</p>\n<p>They first cut the bark, the whole length of the stick, witha sharp serrated shell, and having carefully peeled it off, rolled it intosmall coils, the inner bark being outside. In this state it is left some time,to make it flat and smooth. Keoa not only worked herself, but appears to takethe superintendence of the whole party. Whenever a fine piece of bark wasfound, it was shown to her, and put aside to be manufactured into <em>wairiirii,</em> orsome other particular cloth. With lively chat and cheerful song, they appearedto beguile the hours of labour until noon, when having finished their work,they repaired to their dwellings.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While this all that is recorded in the account published inBoston in 1825, Ellis used this episode to include several further pages ofdescription of the cultivation of <em>wauke</em> as well as themanufacturing process, listing the types of cloth made and comparing these tomuslin, dimity, and wash-leather in the expanded 1826 version.</p>\n<p>He described red and yellow painted examples were rubbedwith vegetable oil. perfumed with chips of sandal wood or the seeds of <em>pandanusodoratissima</em>, to make them water resistant. <em>Kapa moe</em> was atype of sleeping cloth, coloured white, yellow, brown or black and made fromseveral layers of <em>kapa</em> for the chiefs, while <em>kihei</em> wasmade in the same way but only the size of a shawl, commonly coloured white oryellow mixed with red and black and worn by men over one shoulder:</p>\n<p>But the best kind of cloth made with the cultivated plant isthe <em>wairiirii</em>, which is made into <em>paüs</em> for thefemales and <em>maros</em> for the men. The paüs are generally fouryards long, and about one yard wide, very thick, beautifully pained withbrilliant red, yellow, and black colours, and covered over with a fine gum andresinous varnish, which not only preserves the colours, but renders the clothimpervious and durable. The <em>maros</em> are about a foot wide andthree or four yards long.</p>\n<p>The colours they employ are procured from the leaves, bark,berries, or roots of indigenous plants, and require much skill in theirpreparation. One or two kinds of earth are also used in mixing the darkercolours. Since foreigners have visited them, they have found, upon trial, thatour colours are better than theirs, and the paint they purchase from ships hassuperseded in a great degree the native colours, in the painting of all themost valuable kinds of cloth.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Describing the techniques of printing using engraved bamboo,Ellis was keen that his readers appreciate the ingenuity and skill involvedin <em>kapa</em> production:</p>\n<p>The fabrication of it shews both invention and industry; andwhether we consider its different textures, its varied and regular patterns,its beautiful colours, so admirably preserved by means of the varnish, we areat once convinced, that the people who manufacture it are neither deficient intaste, nor incapable of receiving the improvements of civilised society.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fnref50\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">50</a></sup></p>\n<p>At this point in the text, the footnote referred readers toexamples in the Missionary Museum they could convince themselves of thequality, industry and invention of cloth production with their own eyes.</p>\n<p>The framing of this observation is significant, using theskill inherent in existing forms of production to exemplify the potential forconversion and civilisation. There were many in British society who opposedmissionary activity on a number of different grounds, but Ellis seems keen toevoke artefactual evidence to refute those who would claim that there was nopoint in undertaking missionary work among people incapable of improvingthemselves.</p>\n<p>In the 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum, published inthe same year as Ellis’ account, we find further items that are mentioned inhis text. As well as the specimens of lava and examples of cloth, other itemslisted from the ‘Sandwich Islands’ include baskets used for keeping cloth(1826: 293), a decorated calabash (1826: 349), a <em>páhe</em> or dartused for gaming (1826: 169), as well as a pair of shoes made from bull’s hide,worn by Ellis on his tour (1826: 76). The catalogue also lists a dedicateddisplay case:</p>\n<p>containing a great variety of Articles, brought over by theRev. W. Ellis, most of which have a description attached to them. For a longeraccount see his work lately published.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Other items listed in the 1826 catalogue from the SandwichIslands  include two walking sticks, a shell blown to call people toschool and worship at Oahu, two pieces of wood for making fire and a smalldrum.</p>\n<p>Only one ‘idol’ from Hawai’i was listed – a feathered head‘in a glass case… formerly in Parkinson’s Museum’.  This was theLeverian collection, acquired by Parkinson through a lottery in 1786, but soldat auction in 1806. It seems very likely, then, that this was acquired inHawai’i on Captain Cook’s third voyage. Who presented it to the MissionaryMuseum is unknown.</p>\n<p>Further material, including the large wooden figure fromthe <em>marae</em> at Kairua Bay would eventually find its way toLondon with George Bennet later, and a note was added to the catalogue inexpectation of this:</p>\n<p>It is probably that we shall be able to give a moreparticular description of the South Sea Idols, and the articles, on the returnof the Deputation. Additional Specimens may also be expected.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1921, eleven years after the museum of the LondonMissionary Society had closed and a hundred years after Tyerman and Bennetarrived in the Pacific, the British Museum recorded a donation of eighteensamples bark cloth from the London Missionary Society. They arrived withvirtually no information about where they were originally from.</p>\n<p>Given that many have been identified on stylistic grounds asHawai’ian, it seems very likely that this collection constitutes what remainsof the specimens referred to by Ellis in 1826. Today they offer us afascinating glimpse into Hawai’ian society at a crucial moment of political andreligious transformation. Nevertheless, like William Ellis two centuries ago, Ican’t help being impressed by their visual beauty and the considerable skillthey manifest.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Journal of Voyages and Travels by the Rev.Daniel Tyerman and George Bennet, Esq.

Tales told of people from the southeast with long hair and dark skins wielding sickle-like weapons, terrifying many who heard them. At first Robert Moffat, a young Scottish missionary, dismissed these tales as ‘mere fabrications’, but over time evidence accumulated that the so-called ‘Mantatees’ were rather more than figments of the imagination.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Moffat finally came face-to-face with a large group of these semi-mythical people on 25 June 1823, gathered outside the town of Old Lattakoo (Dithakong), in what is now South Africa’s Northern Cape. He spoke with an elderly man and his son who were part of the group, resting in the shade of a rock. They claimed to be dying of hunger and begged for meat. When the larger group became aware of the missionary, and perhaps more significantly the twelve armed Griqua men on horseback who accompanied him, they surrounded their herd of cattle for protection. Griqua scouts approached the group, but were greeted with a yell, followed by a hail of weapons.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Reinforced by a larger commando from Griqua Town (Klaarwater) the following day, another approach at sunrise met with the same response. At this point Andries Waterboer, the Kaptijn or leader at Griqua Town, began to shoot. Counter-attacks were made, but Moffat recorded in his journal that the enemy were reluctant to be parted from their cattle. Women mixed with men in the defence of the herds, with Moffat complaining that this made it impossible to avoid shooting them.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>After two and a half hours of battle with a mounted Griqua commando of around 100 supported by Bathlaping warriors firing poisoned arrows, ‘the Mantatees’, on foot and armed with only spears, clubs and axes, attempted to retreat. They made their way into the town which they set alight, perhaps in the hope of creating a distraction. The Griqua, however, pursued the retreating group for eight miles, capturing over 1000 head of cattle.</p>\n<p>Moffat recorded that between 400 and 500 ‘Mantatees’ were killed during seven hours of fighting, with only one Tswana combatant killed ‘perhaps from too much boldness in plunder’.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> The disparity in casualties makes it clear how decisive an advantage firearms and horses gave to the Griqua, compared with other groups operating in the African interior.</p>\n<p>Moffat’s eyewitness account of what has become known as ‘the Battle of Dithakong’, written in his journal but published in abridged form in the Missionary Chronicle soon after, in January 1824, is somewhat ambivalent.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He attempts to position himself as witness and bystander, but acknowledges that he was responsible for requesting the assistance of the Griqua when told of approaching ‘Mantatees’, as well as for supplying them with gunpowder.</p>\n<p>Moffat remained with the Griqua commando for his own safety, but was, by his own admission, far from being in command of these rather expert fighters. He claims not to have discharged a single shot ‘as fighting was not my province’, but remained implicated in the violent confrontation that unfolded as he watched.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Having worried about the shooting of women, he evidently became even more upset when Batlhaping warriors joined the fray, killing wounded men, women and children with spears and axes ’like voracious wolves’ with ‘savage ferocity… and severing the head from the body, for the sake of a few paltry rings’. Moffat states that he galloped among them to prevent this slaughter, inducing many women to sit on the ground, bare their breasts and cry ‘we are women’.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Moffat and the only other European present, John Melvill, a former Government Surveyor at the Cape who had given up a healthy salary to become a government agent at Griqua Town (and would later resign this post to become an LMS missionary), took responsibility for ‘collecting the prisoners’, mostly women and children, after the main body of Griquas ‘galloped forward, anxious to divide the spoil’ – the large herd of captured cattle. At this point, Moffat used italics to remark to his journal: They are heathens still.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Spoils of battle were not confined to cattle, however, and Moffat noted that the path taken by the retreating enemy was ‘thickly strewed with karosses, victuals, utensils, ornaments, and weapons, which the Bechuanas eagerly gathered up’.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> If Moffat was merely a witness to these scenes of plunder, as his journal implies, how did a number of items apparently taken at the battle, including ‘a Mantatese apron’, find their way to the Missionary Museum in London, and from there to the British Museum where they remain today?</p>\n<p>The Battle of Dithakong has come to assume a central place in historical understandings of a period violence, disruption and significant population displacement that unfolded across the interior of southern Africa during the 1820s, known widely as the mfecane or difaqane (depending on which southern Bantu language grouping is preferred). Eyewitness accounts of the battle, provided by both Moffat and Melvill, as well as by George Thompson, a Cape Town merchant involved in run up, though not at the battle itself, makes it one of the best documented conflicts of the period.</p>\n<p>After battles later in the century that saw both British troops and Boer voortrekkers on the losing side against Zulu regiments, historians widely connected the conflicts and migrations of the 1820s to the rise of the Zulu kingdom on South Africa’s southeast coast, under its most charismatic King, Shaka. If the history of the world was the biography of great men, then Shaka became a conquering African hero in the form most admired by Thomas Carlyle (1840) – a South African Napoleon.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1966, John Omer-Cooper, based for over a decade at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria where historians were attempting to write African history for its own sake as the country embraced independence, published The Zulu Aftermath, a synthetic work that attempted to Africanise South African history.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> According to one of his contemporaries, Omer-Cooper ‘sought to restore the dignity of Africans as positive actors in their history’.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Omer-Cooper presented the mfecane as an internally generated African revolution with little to do with European engagements in the region – an independent African history for an independent Africa.</p>\n<p>In 1988, Julian Cobbing, writing in South Africa in advance of the end of apartheid published a paper that attempted to upend this way of seeing things. In ’the Mfecane as Alibi’, Cobbing suggested that the notion of the mfecane was a construction of settler history that framed the depopulation of South Africa’s landscape in terms of black-on-black violence in order to justify its occupation by incoming settlers. He pointed out the ways in which it had been propagated ‘with unbelievable rapidity’ through South African universities, schools, the press, television and cinema after 1970 (Shaka Zulu, a major TV series produced by the South AfricanBroadcasting Corporation, first aired in 1986).⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>For Cobbing the ‘Afrocentrism’ of the mfecane myth conformed to a pattern – in South Africa’s historical texts whites and blacks were covered in separate chapters with their interactions ‘generally ignored’. As Marxism, in the form of dialectical materialism, came to dominate the theoretical imaginations of many South African scholars during the 1970s and 80s, the idea of ‘a purely internal revolution in ‘Bantu Africa’’’ came to seem increasingly naive – reinforcing the apartheid state’s continued efforts to maintain distinct administrative and conceptual frameworks to account for its variously racialised citizens and subjects.</p>\n<p>For Cobbing, the ‘motor of change… was not a self-generated internal revolution with a short time-scale, but rather European penetration, against which black societies threw up a series of complex reactive states, that matured over a much longer period of time’.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup>  While many of Cobbing’s arguments focused on the details on Zulu history, he deployed the Battle of Dithakong as a pivot ‘on which to hinge a case study’ to test and challenge the assumptions of mfecane theory.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Cobbing argued that the ‘battle’ was an unprovoked ‘slave (and cattle) raid’ that amounted to a ‘seven-hour massacre’.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> He suggested that a shortage of labour in the Cape, following the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, the exclusion from the Colony of ‘black’ labourers in 1809, and the arrival of British settlers in 1820 made battle captives, particularly women and young boys, extremely valuable.  According to Cobbing:</p>\n<p>The missionaries tried to depict themselves as succouring the prisoners, and rescuing them from the evil chiefs and starvation (with all those cattle?). There is no doubt, however, that they were fully and consciously engrossed in what they were doing, i.e. collecting slaves, and that the cover of hypocrisy was intended to deflect the certain censure from the government in London and from their seniors in the London Missionary Society if it has leaked out that they were selling people into slavery.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Re-reading Moffat’s account of the battle thirty-five years after Cobbing published his paper and twenty-five years after I first encountered it on my undergraduate reading list, I remain far from convinced that the missionary was ‘consciously engrossed’ in capturing slaves, however much he may have struggled to account for the events in which he played a part. Moffat was certainly no saint – he regularly came into conflict with others while forcefully pursuing his own agendas – but I remain unconvinced that re-casting him as a villain helps us to better understand the conflict or its wider implications for African history.</p>\n<p>While I recognise that an entirely ‘Afrocentric’ framing of the violence of the 1820s is potentially naive, both historically and politically, I can’t help feeling that making Europeans the sole ‘motor of change’ potentially reiterates a narrative of African victimhood, denying a right of self-determination in relation to the way Africans responded to historical events.</p>\n<p>In the context of recent battles around the focus and meaning of ‘decolonisation’, Olúfémi Táíwo has pointed to the risk that ‘making European colonisation the pole around which we build our explanatory and narrative structures’ can mean we fail to take African agency seriously.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> There were, after all, many Africans on both sides of the battle that day, but only two Europeans.</p>\n<p>As I try to make sense of what happened at Dithakong on 26 June 1823, I return to the surviving textual accounts. Is it possible that Robert Moffat found himself caught in the crossfire of historical forces, and wrote in his journal to figure out what had just happened and what it meant, just as I am also trying to do two centuries later?</p>\n<p>I also return to the artefacts that were associated with ‘the Mantatees’ at the Missionary Museum. Are these straightforward trophies – looted from the field of battle as plunder, as Cobbing’s framing of the battle might suggest? Or are they something a little more ambivalent – a form of evidence that anchors the textual accounts, becoming an alternative source to be consulted even while a degree of uncertainty about exactly who ‘the Mantatees’ were, and what they were doing at Dithakong remains.</p>\n<p>Ambiguous and ambivalent, their digital images continue to bear witness to an event around which competing narratives continue to swirl. Perhaps in order to better assess the reliability of Robert Moffat’s account, we need to know a little about who he was and what he was doing at Dithakong in the first place.</p>\n<p>Born at Ormiston in Scotland in 1795, Moffat spent a period at sea as a cabin boy before being apprenticed to a gardener at the age of fourteen. Working at an estate in Cheshire, he became involved with the Methodist movement, ultimately coming under the influence of William Roby, minister of the Grosvenor Street Congregational Church in Manchester. Roby arranged for Moffat to be employed at a garden nursery in the city in 1816, while he prepared for life as a missionary.</p>\n<p>In September 1816, Moffat travelled to the headquarters to of the London Missionary Society, where according to a letter he sent to his parents:</p>\n<p>I spent some time in viewing the museum, which contains a great number of curiosities from China, Africa, South Seas and West Indies. It would be foolish for me to give you a description. Suffice it to say that the sight is truly awful, the appearance of the wild beasts is terrific, but I am unable to describe the sensations of my mind when gazing on the objects of pagan worship. Alas! how fallen my fellow-creatures, bowing down to forms enough to frighten a Roman soldier, enough to shake the hardest heart. Oh that I had a thousand lives, and a thousand bodies: all of them should be devoted to no other employment but to preach Christ to these degraded, despised, yet beloved mortals. I had not repented in becoming a missionary, and should I die in the march, and never enter the field of battle, all will be well.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The recently opened museum clearly served to reinforce, if not inspire, the commitment of aspiring missionaries such as Moffat. At a service on 30 September involving John Campbell, the ‘African traveller’, Moffat was dedicated for missionary service alongside eight others, four for the Pacific (including John Williams) and four others for South Africa. On 18 October, he sailed for South Africa on the Alacrity, arriving at Cape Town in January 1817.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Permission to leave the colony was refused by the Governor, who was concerned that Griqua Town was becoming a place of refuge for servants and slaves fleeing the colony, so Moffat lodged at a wine farm in Stellenbosch where he learned Dutch until he received permission to go to Namaqualand the following September.</p>\n<p>Moffat arrived at the kraal of Jager Afrikaner (literally African Hunter) in late January 1818. A métis group of Khoe descent, much like the Griqua, Afrikaner’s people had a reputation as raiders and rustlers who traded cattle and ivory with the Colony from the lands beyond. Jager was an outlaw with a price on his head, having killed the white farmer by whom the group had originally been employed (and with whom they had engaged in raids).</p>\n<p>Three German missionaries, recruited by Johannes Kicherer during his visit to Europe, had begun work with Afrikaner’s people in 1805. One of these, Johannes Seidenfaden, later memorably described as ‘a wolf in sheep’s clothing’, seems to have set about enriching himself from the proceeds of Afrikaner’s ivory trade with the Cape, which provided the guns and powder necessary for hunting and raiding.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1811, Jäger Afrikaner raided Seidenfaden’s mission station at Pella, pillaging his house and taking a barrel of gunpowder and a pair of guns, forcing the missionaries to retreat to Cape Town. Following a visit by John Campbell in 1813, a mission was re-established with Afrikaner in 1815, and in July of that year he was baptised – an event the historian Nigel Penn has regarded as marking the beginning of a a process of closure for the Cape colony’s northern frontier.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1819, Robert Moffat arranged for Afrikaner to travel to Cape Town, where he displayed his credentials as an exemplary convert, in the process being awarded a wagon and the right to enter the colony by the governor.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup> While in Cape Town, Moffat met John Campbell and John Philip, fellow Scots who had been sent by the Directors of the LMS to adjudicate in a complicated set of grievances brought by a new generation of missionaries, including Moffat, against the older guard.</p>\n<p>Campbell and Philip persuaded Moffat not to abandon his missionary calling, but rather to accompany them as an interpreter on a journey of inspection while he awaited the arrival of his intended bride, whose parents had finally agreed that she could make the journey from Manchester. Having visited Bethelsdorp and other mission stations in the East of the colony, Moffat and Philip returned to Cape Town where they met Mary on her arrival in December 1819 (her own inspiration for missionary work came from hearing John Campbell speaking in Manchester about his first journey to South Africa).⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup></p>\n<p>Robert and Mary were married 19 days later, and it was decided that Moffat should take over the mission at New Lattakoo (Maruping) – James Read, originally stationed at Bethelsdorp with Vanderkemp in 1799, had taken himself there in self-imposed exile after admitting to charges of sexual impropriety.</p>\n<p>The Moffats travelled north with John Campbell early in 1820, arriving at Griqua Town late in the evening on 13 March where they found men making square buildings out of stone and women ‘dressed in European fashion’ sewing cotton clothes. While there, a wagon arrived with a party of thirty Batlhaping led by a Griqua missionary, Jan Hendric, who taking ivory to trade at a market arranged at the edge of the Cape Colony at Beaufort West, 500km to the South.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 21 March, Campbell and the Moffats set off for Kuruman, and on their journey encountered more people taking skins, assegais, knives, shields to trade for beads at fair. Campbell noticed that compared to his journey four years earlier, wild game had become much scarcer due to the hunting activities of Griqua and their guns.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Arriving at the mission, they found a row of missionary houses behind a neat reed fence, with gardens at the back, as well as a church capable of holding four hundred people. They had brought a bell to be hung near the church to replace the horn used previously to summon people to worship.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup></p>\n<p>They were visited at the home off Robert Hamilton by the King or Kgosi, Mothibi, as well as various other nobles , who were presented with gifts ranging from snuff, beads and buttons to tinder-boxes and kaleidoscopes. Moffat bargained for a two gallon wooden container, made by the neighbouring Bakwena, while some of the visitors amused themselves examining portraits from the Evangelical Magazine displayed on the walls, including one of Campbell himself.</p>\n<p>Campbell expressed his satisfaction that under the influence of James Read, Mothibi had ceased the system of commandoes to raid cattle from neighbouring groups, but Mothibi pointed out that without this source of income, he needed guns and gunpowder to hunt wild animals.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Campbell and Read departed on a journey to the North, visiting Dithakong as well as the substantial city of Kaditshwene – but also meeting Campbell’s old friend Cupido Kakkerlak then serving as a missionary to the Coranna – the Moffats stayed at Maruping to establish relationships at what would become their new station.</p>\n<p>In the meantime Jager Afrikaner arrived with a wagon of Moffat’s belongings, including many books. When Campbell returned to the colony with Read, much to the displeasure of the residents of Maruping, the Moffats went for a time to Griqua Town, before joining Hamilton permanently at the mission in May 1821, still in their mid-twenties.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was at in the course of attempting a journey of his own to the Tswana towns of the North-East that Moffat met reports that invading Mantatees close at hand had in fact overrun many of these towns, including Kaditshwene. Fearing for the safety of his young family, he returned to Maruping to decide on a course of action. While the Batlhaping prepared for war, Moffat rode to Griqua Town to request assistance.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On June 13 1823, a pitsho or parliament of armed men, assembled. One old man exhorted the crowd by telling them it was the pitsho of the missionary, and as such they should speak and act not like Batswana but like Makgoas (white people). The Makgoas, meanwhile, buried their possessions so that they could make a quick escape.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup></p>\n<p>uccess in repelling the invading ‘Mantatees’ seems to have marked a significant material change for both the Moffat household, by then featuring two very young children, and the mission of which they formed a part. In a letter to Mary’s parents dated 23 July 1823, from Griqua Town less than a month after the battle, Robert Moffat declared that four of the ‘prisoners’ were ‘inmates’ of his family:</p>\n<p>Mason or Mahum (Mmahuma), a woman about 25 yeas of age; Moshanee, also a woman, rather older; Fahaange, a boy, about eight years old; and a girl about four (Niywe). Mary has made Mahum, cook, and Moshanee nurse and washerwoman; and the boy, who seems clever, I shall find useful. Considering their former savage state, they do exceedingly well. Moshanee makes a good nurse, and helps to wash very well. This is a great comfort to Mary, as washing is her greatest hardship in this climate. They seem very happy in their new situation, and pleased with their clothes…⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Returning to Maruping in August, Moffat found his garden destroyed but much of his former home in a better state than expected. He subsequently rescued another starving refugee be found being beaten with stones by some boys, taking her to his kitchen where he gave her food and clothing.</p>\n<p>The provision of food and clothes allowed Moffat to present the ‘Mantatees’ as the recipients of charity, but their deployment as supplementary household labour – feeding and washing the Moffat family – suggests that the relationship was rather more complicated. Indeed, their exact status seems to have been fairly ambiguous – the fact that Moffat refers to them as ‘prisoners’ and ‘inmates’ seems significant.</p>\n<p>Moffat used his newfound influence to argue for the mission’s relocation to a reedy valley eight miles closer to the spring at Kuruman known as Seodin – a seemingly ideal location for someone trained as a gardener. Kgosi Mothibi agreed to grant two miles of the valley adjacent to the island to the missionaries, noting that their presence might provide protection for his cattle from raiding nearby ‘bushmen’.</p>\n<p>These arrangements having been made in principle, Moffat set off for Cape Town in October 1823 to seek approval from LMS superintendent John Philip, with a promise to return with the necessary goods for a remuneration – variously described as 40lbs of beads or a small sum of around £5.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Moffat took with him Kgosi Mothibi’s son and heir, Phetlu, as well as an advisor, Thaišo, who became celebrities at the Cape. They visited the city’s famous castle, its schools as well as the museum, a year before its official establishment. George Thompson, who had met them during preparations for the battle, commissioned their portraits by a recently arrived English artist, Henry Clifford de Meillon. Phetlu and Thaišo seem to have been struck by the ships, but were especially pleased when presented with two guns and some powder by the Governor, who they told ‘had made their hearts white’.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was presumably from Cape Town that Moffat forwarded a series of items to the Missionary Museum, had so impressed him just over seven years earlier. These were listed in the Catalogue of the Missionary Museum, printed in 1826 with a description on page 38:</p>\n<p>NECK RINGS, used by the Chiefs’ wives of the Mantantese.</p>\n<p>The nation is very remote in the interior of South Africa, about 40,000 of whom left their country on a plundering expedition, pillaging all the counties through which they passed, till they reached the city of Lattakoo, in the neighbourhood of which they were repulsed. On this occasion, these rings, with various other articles, were taken. The four rings were worn by one female.</p>\n<p>COPPER ORNAMENTS, worn by the same nation.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In addition, the following items featured as part of a list of material from a shelf on page 42:</p>\n<ol start=\"29\">\n<li>\n<p>A COPPER RING, from the Mantantese.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Mantantese NEEDLE.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Mantantese KNIFE.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Mantantese APRON.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A later version of the catalogue, printed around 1860 listed the same apron as:</p>\n<p>A Manatee female apron of iron beads. – Presented by Rev. R. Moffat</p>\n<p>While it seems likely that this was picked up on the field of battle, it remains possible that it was given to Moffat by one of the women who was taken into his household when they were provided with European clothes. This ambiguity parallels the ambiguous legal status of the women. Were they refugees or captives, enslaved or free?</p>\n<p>As well as these ‘Mantatee’ artefacts, Moffat seems to have taken five ‘Mantatee’ women and a boy with him to Cape Town. While there are no surviving individual portraits like those of Phetlu and Thaišo, George Thompson’s 1827 account of his Travels and Adventures in Southern Africa does include a vignette of ‘Mantatee Portraits’ at the beginning of Chapter XVI. A footnote on p.320 states that they were rescued by Messrs. Melvill, Hamilton and Moffat:</p>\n<p>The female, by name Mahum, has a mild and pleasing countenance, as, indeed, most of the Mantatee females have, indicating nothing of cannibal ferocity. She is now in Cape Town, and has proved herself a very good and faithful servant.</p>\n<p>The other figure is that of a boy about nine years of age, named Tahana. He was saved by Mr. Moffat, and having lost all his own relatives, has become affectionately domesticated in the family of his benefactor.</p>\n<p>A report in the Missionary Chronicle for November 1824 suggests that their status remained uncertain within the colony, since when travelling through Stellenbosch, the Mantatee women, walking at a small distance from the wagon were arrested by two constables and taken to prison. When missionaries appealed to the Landdrost the following morning, the women were released. However, it does not seem to have been the constables alone who were unclear about the legal status of these women within the colony.</p>\n<p>When asked about the captives from the battle at an enquiry on 20 April 1824, Moffat declared that rather than being captives:</p>\n<p>the women and children, who were left on the field, abandoned and famished, were offered protection, which many of them accepted, to save their lives; and it was explained to them by Mr. Melville and myself, that they had the option of following in search of their tribe, or of remaining; a few went away, but the greater part remained on the field, and a few came with us; these were taken into the houses of those Griquas who were able to provide for them. It will probably now have been settled on what footing they are to remain with them.</p>\n<p>Mr. Melville sent some of them to Graaf Rennet… The Mantatee women, I have understood, were distributed in the colony amongst the Boors, but upon what footing I do not know. The Griquas entrusted to bring them into the colony received 100 rix dollars from the landdrost…</p>\n<p>I brought six into the colony. Three were left with Mr. Baird at Beaufort, from my knowledge of the care he would take of them, and two are in the care of Dr. Philip. One I brought down, at the request of Mr. Melville, for his sister; but as she had died I made this woman over to Mr Melville’s father-in-law, who I remember to have exposed his intention of having her booked in; but I admonished him that the woman was free, not understanding what he meant by booking in.</p>\n<p>Robert Moffat may not have thought he was engaged in a slave raid, but that clearly doesn’t mean that everyone else, including the ‘Mantatee women’ themselves, regarded things that way. He declared in 1824 that the Botswana ‘have a servile class, but no slaves’, but quite how the captives of battle expected to be treated remains unclear from a distance of two centuries.</p>\n<p>In 1823, slavery continued to exist within the Cape Colony although the 1807 abolition of the slave trade had cut off the supply of enslaved people to this largely plantation-based economy. How different in practice, if perhaps not in law, was the status of the young orphaned Tahana when ‘affectionately domesticated in the family of his benefactor’, to that of someone who had been formally enslaved?</p>\n<p>Does it make a difference today whether the metal apron was taken from the body of someone who was alive or dead, or indeed whether it was taken by Moffat himself or rather by an African combatant?</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup>: Schapera, I. 1951.

The Rev. Dr. David Bogue, however, directed the meeting’s attention to the achievements of two of his former students, Dr Robert Morrison and Dr William Milne, who had recently produced a translation of the Bible into Chinese:</p>\n<p>By their labours the Scriptures are rendered intelligible to some hundreds of millions of the human race. Strange! (Said Dr. B.) strange! That 1800 years should have been suffered to elapse before the Bible should be translated into the language of the most numerous class of people of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Three decades earlier, Bogue’s appeal <em>To the evangelical dissenters who practice infant baptism</em> had led to the establishment of the Missionary Society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He had personally volunteered for missionary service in India in 1796, along with his former student Robert Haldane, but they had been blocked by the East India Company. Having studied Divinity at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, Bogue thought missionaries needed a rigorous education, including a working knowledge of Greek, Latin and Hebrew, to allow them to translate the Bible, which he felt was more important than preaching, at least initially.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the early years of the Missionary Society, Bogue’s vision came up against that of Thomas Haweis, an Oxford-educated Anglican from Cornwall, who thought it sufficient to despatch ‘godly mechanics’ as missionaries. Haweis’ approach eventually bore fruit after two decades with the conversion of Pomare at Tahiti by the bricklayer Henry Nott (chapter 4). During the Society’s first decade, however, many ‘godly mechanics’ abandoned their stations in Tahiti and South Africa prompting the Directors to reconsider their approach.</p>\n<p>In 1800 Bogue was made responsible for training prospective missionaries at his Gosport Academy in Hampshire, where he had trained Independent Ministers since 1789. Robert Morrison was one of the early missionary students, arriving in 1804.</p>\n<p>Two decades later, Morrison sat listening to Bogue’s speech, having recently returned from China. At the prompting of others, he stood to address the meeting, holding a letter of instructions he had been given by the Society’s treasurer, Joseph Hardcastle, in early 1807:</p>\n<p>At that period I was considered a Lay-Missionary, – a sort of mathematician sent to gain, if practicable, a residence in yonder region. The acquisition of the language was thought scarcely possible; though a faint hope was entertained that it might be acquired, and that a Dictionary might be composed, and the Holy Scripture might be translated in Chinese; and now, after 17 years residence in that country, I stand here before God and before you this day, and would our esteemed friend were yet on earth to witness our laying before the Society the scarcely anticipated result of this undertaking.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Morrison then presented a copy of the Bible along with ‘a copy of the Chinese and English Dictionary’ to the assembled London Missionary Society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Morrison was clear that ultimate credit for his achievements rested with God. Nevertheless, the success of his mission to China, and particularly his production of the Dictionary, suggest credit was also owed to Britain’s premier joint-stock company, the East India Company, with which he formed a strategic alliance.</p>\n<p>Morrison arrived back in London in March 1824, stopping briefly at Cape Town on his way from China, where he met Robert Moffat (another of Bogue’s former students), presumably with his ‘Mantatee’ captives (Chapter 8). Morrison was himself accompanied on the journey by a Chinese servant, ‘Poon a Sam’, referred to by Bogue in his speech as ‘a Christian Chinese whom we are delighted to see amongst us this day’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Intriguingly, the <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum,</em> printed two years later in 1826, lists a number of items presented by ‘A Sam’ including a pair of shoes, Chinese combs and a brush, two curiously carved coconut cups, as well as the Chinese cup used by Morrison.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This chapter’s title also comes from the four-page ‘CHINA’ section, two-thirds of the way through the <em>Catalogue</em>. Although a number of Chinese ‘idols’ are listed at the beginning of the section, it also includes a type of artefact unlike most others in the <em>Catalogue</em> – printed books. The first to be listed, in a section describing the contents of ‘the fourth shelf’, is Morrison’s ‘<em>Chinese and English dictionary</em>’. This is followed by two of his other books: <em>‘Grammar of the Chinese Language’</em> (1815) and a ‘<em>A View of China for Philological Purposes’ (1817)</em>. Only then is his bible translation listed as:</p>\n<p>A <em>COPY of the SACRED SCRIPTURES of the Old and New Testament, translated into the Chinese language by the indefatigable labours of Dr. Robert Morrison, assisted in part of the work, by the late Dr. Milne, of Malacca.</em></p>\n<p><em>By this great achievement, many millions of the human race may be enlightened in the knowledge of God our Saviour.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This, however, is followed by listings for <em>Four Books on Drawing, published by the Chinese</em> and <em>A Work of Agriculture, &amp;c.</em>‘concerning the husbandry and the cultivation of Silk’ encouraged by Emperor Kang-Hi (Kangxi). Unlike South Africa and Tahiti, where there was no established form of writing, China had its own history of textual production. Indeed, Bogue seems to have felt that literacy was an important marker of ‘civilisation’, necessitating an approach to missionary work that was rooted in textual production.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Chinese books in the Missionary Museum may have formed a small part of the library of nearly 10,000 Chinese books which Morrison brought with him from China. It is curious, particularly perhaps for a Protestant missionary society, that the ‘Sacred Scriptures’ appear to be sandwiched between works on the Chinese language and others on drawing and agriculture, given the emphasis given to ‘this great achievement’ with its potential for conveying ‘the knowledge of God our Saviour’.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this ordering reflects the arrangement of the volumes on the shelf, with the bible displayed at its centre. It may also be progressive, suggesting that it was Morrison’s dictionary and grammar that ultimately enabled his translation of the <em>Sacred Scriptures</em>. In any case, it is significant that the dictionary and the bible translation were presented to the Society together in May 1824, and continued to be displayed alongside each other at the museum, since these two major works competed for Morrison’s time and attention over nearly two decades.</p>\n<p>While the Bible translation was funded by the London Missionary Society, with contributions from the British and Foreign Bible Society (established by a similarly non-denominational group of evangelicals in 1804), the three-volume 4,826 page dictionary, printed in six parts between 1815 and 1823, was funded exclusively by the East India Company, to the tune of over £10,000.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Given that the East India Company was officially opposed to the operation of Christian missionaries, as potentially disruptive to trade, how was Morrison able to serve these two masters?</p>\n<p>Born in 1782 at Morpeth in Northumberland in the far north of England, Morrison was the youngest of eight children. His father had been a Scottish farm labourer who moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne to work as a shoe-tree maker. Following an apprenticeship with his father, Morrison applied to train as a minister, moving to London to study at the Hoxton Academy at the age of twenty. In early 1804 he applied to become a missionary and was sent to Bogue’s Gosport Academy to complete his training. Morrison hoped he might go with Mungo Park to Timbuktu in Africa, and prayed that God send him ‘to some situation where he will make me abundantly useful to the souls of men’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1805, the London Missionary Society directors outlined a plan to send missionaries to Prince of Wales Island (Penang – under East India Company control since 1786), where it was hoped they would learn Chinese with the aim of translating the Bible.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Morrison began to learn Chinese with Yong Samtak (Rong Sande) from Canton (Guangzhou), who had come to London on an East India Company ship to learn English. Together they transcribed <em>Evangelia Quatuor Sinica</em>, a manuscript copy of a harmony of the gospels in Chinese, made by Jesuits in the 18<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> century, which had recently been found at the British Museum.</p>\n<p>Ordained in early 1807, Morrison left London at the end of January with two missionaries bound for India. Since the East India Company, which held a trading monopoly in China, refused to carry missionaries in their ships, they sailed first to New York. On arrival, Morrison went to Philadelphia to meet American missionary supporters in the hope they could provide him with a letter of introduction to the American Consul at Canton, the only place Europeans were permitted to trade in China after 1757.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sailing in mid-May, Morrison arrived at the Thirteen Factories in September 1807, having briefly met English residents at Macau, approximately 60km to the South near the mouth of the Pearl River. They told him the Chinese were forbidden from teaching outsiders on pain of death, and that working in Macau would be difficult on account of Catholic resentments in this Portuguese-controlled entrepôt. Morrison’s letter of instruction from Hardcastle made it clear that, many months travel from London, he was at ‘liberty to act on every occasion according to the dictates of your own prudence and discretion’, suggesting he find employment as a mathematician or teacher of English.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Morrison found lodgings in the old French Factory, under the supervision of American traders. The First American ships had arrived in 1784, shortly after the treat of Paris granted independence to the United States, and by the time Morrison arrived the major trade good they brought was sandalwood from Hawai’i and other Pacific islands (Chapter seven). Morrison, pretending to be American, worked secretly to learn Chinese, with assistance from Yin Kwan-ming (Abel Yin), a Chinese Catholic from Peking (Beijing). He was also taught Cantonese by Le Sëensang (Li Xiansheng), a Catholic whose father had undergone priestly training with Jesuits in Portugal  for twelve years.</p>\n<p>In November 1807, before the Missionary Museum was established in London, Morrison sent a number of curiosities back to Joseph Hardcastle. These included a figure of Kwan-yin (one of these is the first item listed in the CHINA section of the 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum), three weapons used by Malays (three KRIS from JAVA are listed in the 1826 catalogue), a pair of wooden sandals, as well as paintings ‘illustrative of the idolatry of this benighted people’. He also sent a book – a history of China which he asked be sent to the Royal Society, since he knew no copy was then available in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Morrison asked Hardcastle to send him copies of the Missionary Magazine, a little more money (he found living as a European in Canton  exorbitant), as well as some striped pocket handkerchiefs – ‘a very acceptable present to the Chinese’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By December 1807, Morrison had acquired between four and five hundred volumes in Chinese on language, religion, philosophy, medicine, laws and history. Partly for financial reasons, Morrison initially adopted Chinese styles of dress and food, but came to see this ultimately made him more conspicuous, living as he was among the European and American traders within the restricted factory zone.</p>\n<p>In June 1808, Morrison travelled to the English factory at Macao, 100 miles to the South, remaining for three months to improve his health. He was, at that time, assisted to find a house by the chief of the English factory and representative of the East India Company, John Roberts, to enable his work on a Chinese Dictionary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In October, the English were expelled from Canton after East India Company troops occupied Macao, ostensibly to protect it from the French, so Morrison returned to Macao but seems to have felt he would soon need to move to Penang, as originally proposed.</p>\n<p>While at Macao, however, Morrison formed a close friendship with the evangelically minded Morton family from Ireland, recently arrived traders, and on 20 February 1809 he married Mary Morton, their eldest daughter. On the same day he was offered a post as Chinese Translator and Secretary for the East India Company’s Factory at Canton, with a salary of £500 a year. This provided him with an official position, allowing him to continue studying the language, working on the Chinese Dictionary, while continuing his translation of the bible privately. When informed of these developments, the Missionary Society’s representatives divined the gracious hand of God.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By September 1810, Morrison had revised a translation of the Acts of the Apostles based on the manuscript in London, and had 1000 copies printed secretly. By the end of the same year he revised a translation of Luke’s gospel, which he also printed locally. Writing from London in March 1812, Hardcastle and Burder thanked Morrison for the three copies of his translation of Acts which he had sent them, noting:</p>\n<p>we could have wished the number had been larger, for the sake of gratifying some of our friends in the country, and the Directors hope that when you shall have printed another portion of the Sacred Word they shall receive at least two dozen copies. One of the three with which you favoured us was presented by us to the British and Foreign Bible Society, who kindly voted £500 towards the important object of printing the Sacred Scriptures in the Chinese language; and another copy was ordered to be unstitched for distribution among the friends of the Society in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, who have expressed themselves gratified, in no small degree, to behold the first-fruits of the labours of their missionary in China, on whose behalf the prayers of thousands have been, doubtless, thereby excited.</p>\n<p>As a specimen of Chinese typography, it could not fail to excite more than ordinates attention as an oriental curiosity; but, to the eye of every friend of missions, it presented an ocular demonstration of the existence of the Book of Books in the language of so large a portion of the human race.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> We especially rejoice in hearing that the improvement in the art of printing, by means of stereotype, is not confined to Europe, but that from your wood-cut characters you are assured that, by occasionally retouching them when necessary, a hundred thousand copies may be procured.</p>\n<p>While the adoption of stereotype printing – using a single solid printing block for each page of text – was a new technology in Europe that was in the process of replacing plates composed from individual letters of moveable type, the technique used by Morrison’s Chinese printers was far from new.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Indeed, woodblock printing, with each page of text composed on a carved wooden block, dated back over a thousand years in China.</p>\n<p>When Morrison completed printing Luke’s gospel he only sent one copy to London, perhaps because he felt that as a book it would be more valuable to those who could actually read it. Nevertheless, the Society’s representatives in London were mindful of the propaganda value of ‘ocular proof’ of Morrison’s work of translation, even if it meant unbinding books so that individual pages could be circulated to supporters.</p>\n<p>The same letter, written in March 1812, updated Morrison with news of fellow missionaries in Africa and the Pacific, informing him that he would soon be joined by a missionary colleague, William Milne, a Scot, recommended by Dr Bogue.</p>\n<p>In 1812, the Chinese Emperor expelled four Catholic missionaries from Peking (Beijing) and issued an edict which made printing books in Chinese on the Christian religion a capital crime. Morrison began to think that missionary work in China needed an institution to train Chinese missionaries in the Malayan archipelago, where a mission press could print translations and tracts beyond the influence of the Emperor.</p>\n<p>In September 1812, the Rev. William Milne and his wife left Britain, arriving in Macao in early July the following year. As a result of lobbying by the Catholic bishop, the council at Macao declared that he could not stay, so he went to Canton alone, European women not being allowed at the Thirteen Factories. Finding Canton challenging without an association with the East India Company, Milne travelled to Java, Malacca and Penang, all then under British control, to find a suitable location to establish a mission, returning to Canton in September 1813.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile. the East India Company despatched a printer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Perring_Thoms\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Perring Thoms</a>, who arrived in China in September 1814 with a press and the necessary equipment to begin printing Morrison’s Chinese dictionary. Thoms was paid £300 a year by the Company, working with local assistants who cut Chinese fonts in tin alloy. 1814 saw the completion of Morrison’s translation of the New Testament, based on the manuscript at the British Museum, but also the baptism of his first convert, Tsae Tia A-Ko (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cai_Gao\" target=\"_blank\">Cai Gao</a>), one of the type-cutters.</p>\n<p>In 1815 Morrison’s <em>Chinese Grammar</em> was printed by the Mission Press at Serampore in India, funded by the East India Company, while Thoms began printing the first part of the first volume of his dictionary. The ongoing ill-health of Mary, Morrison’s wife meant that she travelled to London early that year, together with their two young children. In April, Morrison was once again left alone, when the Milnes left to establish what was called the Ultra Ganges Mission. Malacca was chosen as the best location mostly because of its centrality to areas of Chinese settlement in the Malay archipelago, but also due to its relatively healthy climate and maritime connections to both India and Canton.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ongoing persecution of Christians in China meant that those employed cutting Chinese types for Morrison’s dictionary were seized by the authorities, and in alarm, the book-seller who held the wooden printing blocks for a small edition of his New Testament destroyed them. The Directors of the Missionary Society asked Morrison whether it was cheaper to print his bible translation using the Chinese method with wooden blocks, or with moveable metal types. Morrison seems to have discussed the matter with the Company’s printer, Thoms, ‘who is daily in use of single metal types’ for the Dictionary. According to Morrison, in a reply written in November 1815, if metal stereotype is cheaper than the letter press in Europe, wooden blocks in China are ‘much cheaper than English stereotype’ since a Chinese ‘type-cutter requires only a fair copy’ while English stereotypes had to be cast from pages that were first composed with moveable type:</p>\n<p>The single letters in Chinese being so numerous, and arranged under no fewer than 214 radicals, though each character be a word, it requires more time to find any given word than is necessary to compose it from the Roman letter. A word from a Greek case, with all its accents, would be composed sooner than a Chinese character, from a collection of thirty or forty thousand characters, arranged in the best possible manner.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Morrison estimated that cutting the Chinese characters for the New Testament would cost 800 dollars, when his wood blocks only cost 500 dollars. He also thought that Chinese printers were able to print many more copies a day, and be paid less than European printers. Using the local technique meant that copies of the bible could be printed from the wooden blocks as and when they were needed, with no involvement from Morrison:</p>\n<p>I am myself fully convinced that all than can be said in favour of metal stereotype for printing standard books, applies with fully as much, if not with greater force and truth, to the Chinese wooden stereotype.</p>\n<p>According to Milne, writing from Malacca in December 1815:</p>\n<p>As to the beauty of the <em>impression</em>, which is certainly the very least consideration, the advantage is in favour of the blocks. All Chinese printing with <em>moveable types,</em> even with regularly <em>cast</em> types, that I have yet seen, looks like the work of <em>foreigners</em>, and possesses not that freedom which the Chinese method has. To the Chinese, books printed with moveable types, have a certain awkward stiffness in their appearance.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In October 1815 Morrison received discouraging news – as a result of the Missionary Society publicity surrounding his ongoing translation work, something undertaken outside of his employment, the East India Company’s Court of Directors in London had sent orders that he be dismissed. This was essentially ignored by the Company representatives in China, given how essential Morrison’s translation skills had become to their commercial and diplomatic negotiations in Canton.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, during the second half of 1816 Morrison accompanied a British diplomatic mission to the Qing court in Peking (Beijing), led by Lord Amherst. Ultimately, Amherst refused to kowtow before the emperor and was refused entry to the imperial city. The journey, however, gave Morrison many opportunities to observe life in Imperial China, contributing to his <em>View of China for Philological Purposes,</em> subsequently printed in Macao by Thoms.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Meanwhile at Malacca, in November 1816, Milne baptised <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_Fa\" target=\"_blank\">Liang Fa</a>, a Chinese printer who went there with him the previous year.</p>\n<p>By early 1817, the mission press at Malacca had printed 9000 copies of the New Testament. In June of that year, the Ultra Ganges Mission was reinforced by the arrival a Walter Henry Medhurst, an experienced young printer from London. While work on Bible translation was strengthened by the establishment of a printing workshop at Milne’s mission at Malacca, work on the dictionary in Canton was slowed when its types were seized by Chinese authorities when one of the workmen took a sheet of the Dictionary to the Chinese District Magistrate. When the Viceroy of Canton ordered that foreigners should not assist foreigners in printing the Chinese language, Thoms has to work with Portuguese workmen at Macao to cut Chinese characters for the Dictionary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Reflecting on what had been achieved after a decade in China, Morrison and Milne recognised that without the support of the East India Company, progress on the Dictionary would likely have been much slower. While the Company’s support came ‘no doubt chiefly, if not solely, for commercial and literary purposes’ they suggested that this is no way lessened ‘the usefulness of the work, to those who wish to promote the knowledge of the Gospel in China’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> While Morrison’s work for the East India Company competed for his time with his work on translation, his association with the company provided significant financial resources, as well as connections with established Sinologists such as Sir George Staunton,  enabling his work to gain international recognition.</p>\n<p>In 1817 Morrison was awarded the Degree of Doctor of Divinity by the University of Glasgow, and in 1818 he was able to contribute £1000 towards the establishment of the Anglo-Chinese College at Malacca, to which he promised a further £100 a year for five years. The object of the college was ‘the cultivation of Chinese and European Literature, in order to the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ’, and with Milne appointed its first principal, it was clearly a missionary establishment.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Nevertheless, the College statutes did not exclude ‘any branch of human knowledge; nor any one of the circle of the sciences’ and the College Library was:</p>\n<p>to consist of European and Foreign Books, MSS., Maps. Charts, Drawings and Philosophical Apparatus; to which was to be attached a Museum of natural and artificial curiosities.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is noteworthy that this museum at Malacca followed the establishment of the Missionary Museum in London by only four years. While recent conflicts between creationism and Darwinism can seem emblematic of an anti-scientific attitude among contemporary evangelical Christians, this was not the case in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Science, and perhaps particularly Natural History, were regarded as an important part of the new knowledge that missionary educational establishments intended to communicate. Indeed, this may have been particularly the case in China, where an examination of Catholic missionary history suggested that it had been European scientific knowledge which made Matteo Ricci of greatest interest to the Chinese Emperor.</p>\n<p>Although Milne ultimately found that he had to pay the families of his Chinese students the equivalent to the wages they could earn by manual labour, the Anglo-Chinese College gradually built a reputation for academic excellence (it relocated to Hong Kong in 1843, where today Ying Wa College claims descent from the original College at Malacca).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 25 November 1819, Morrison wrote to the Missionary Society Directors in London somewhat triumphantly, telling them that at last the whole Bible had been translated into Chinese — Milne had worked on the Book of Job as well as the Historical Books of the Old Testament. Morrison acknowledged that the result was based on the Jesuit manuscript at the British Museum, and had imperfections, but understood his efforts in relation to a history of Bible translations into English:</p>\n<p>If Morrison and Milne’s Bible shall, in China, at some subsequent period, hold such a place in reference to a better translation, as Wickliff’s or Tyndale’s now hold in reference to our present English version, many will for ever bless God for the attempt; and neither the Missionary Society, nor the Bible Society, will ever regret the funds they have, or shall yet expend in aid of the object.</p>\n<p>It is not yet 500 years since Wickliff’s bones were dug up and burnt, chiefly because he translated the Scriptures; and it is not yet 300 years since Tyndall was strangled by the hands of the common hangman, and then burnt for the same cause….</p>\n<p>King James’s translators were fifty-four in number, and rendered into their mother tongue in their native country, under the patronage of their prince. Our version is the work of two persons, or at most of three (including the author of the MS).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>He was, of course, only thinking of the European translators and it is important to recognise the labours of the many Chinese who worked alongside both Morrison and Milne to undertake this work. It is significant that they appear in a number of images showing Morrison at work, suggesting a close partnership.</p>\n<p>Morrison hoped that ‘Moses, David, and the prophets; Jesus Christ and his apostles, using their own words’ would dispel ‘the gloomy darkness of pagan scepticism’ and that the ‘gilded idols of Budh, and the numberless images which fill the land, will one day assuredly fall to the ground, before the force of God’s word, as the idol Dagon fell before the ark’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In August 1820, Morrison’s wife returned to China after nearly six years away together with their children, but she sadly died less than a year later. In early 1822, Morrison arranged for his son and daughter to be sent back to Britain, but another tragedy followed when Milne died in the midst of revising the last two books of the Bible for printing.</p>\n<p>Morrison’s Dictionary was also nearing completion, with Part III printed in 1822. However, a major fire at Canton in November 1822 caused significant damage, including the destruction of ‘a hundred pounds worth of paper’ Morrison had intended to send to Malacca to print the Bible.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Reflecting on the anniversary of fifteen years in China, Morrison was frustrated that neither his dictionary nor Bible translation had yet been printed in full, but nevertheless took significant pride in the establishment of the Anglo-Chinese College, suggesting it had provoked the establishment of both the Serampore College and the Episcopal Mission College (Bishop’s College) in Calcutta (Kolkata).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In January 1823 Morrison travelled to Malacca where he visited the Anglo-Chinese College for the first time. The following month he went to the recently established East India Company settlement at Singapore, where he discussed relocating the college with Sir Stamford Raffles.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Back in London, Morrison’s long-term correspondent and supporter, Sir George Staunton, was in the process of setting up an Oriental Library and Museum, as part of the establishment of an Asiatic Society in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By November 1823, both the Bible and the Dictionary had been printed and it was proposed that the East India Company press be sent to the Anglo-Chinese College. By that time, the college had a library of 3380 volumes (2850 in Chinese), as well as scientific equipment that included an ‘electrical machine and battery’, perhaps brought to China by Morrison in 1807.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The museum contained Chinese drawings, maps and charts, as well as ‘Specimens of Chinese Court Beads, Musical Instruments, Sounding Vases used in Temples, Bronze Figures, Specimens of Weights and Measures, Specimens of Materia Medica of China’ as well as, somewhat intriguingly ’Specimens of the rocks in Palestine, Birds of Paradise, Cups of Bacchus, and Petrefactions’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>With his Dictionary and Bible translation printed, Morrison finally seems to have felt able to return home. He sailed in an East Indiaman, the <em>Waterloo,</em> in early December 1823, along with around 10,000 printed volumes in Chinese. Arriving in March the following year, he began a lengthy negotiation to avoid paying import duties on his library, which seems to have been taken up on his behalf by Staunton who also arranged for Morrison to present his Bible translation to King George IV on 15 April 1824.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The East India Company agreed to pay Morrison half his salary while in Britain, and he arranged to visit family in Newcastle before returning to London for the annual meetings of the London Missionary Society, the Bible Society and the Religious Tract Society in May, together with his son, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robert_Morrison\" target=\"_blank\">John Robert Morrison</a>. He then toured France, Ireland and Scotland, as well the major English towns, speaking at missionary meetings, as well as meeting European sinologists.</p>\n<p>When Morrison’s ‘Chinese Library and curiosities’ finally cleared customs in June 1824, they were transferred to the London Missionary Society headquarters, where a catalogue was prepared by his servant, A Sam.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Morrison attempted to negotiate with the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge to establish a professorship in Chinese language as a condition of the gift of his library, but was ultimately unsuccessful. As a result, in 1825, he attempted to establish a ‘Universal Language Institution’ in London, a collaboration between the London, Church, Baptist and Wesleyan Missionary Societies. Morrison offered a three-month course of lectures in Chinese to prospective missionaries while Rev. Henry Townley, having recently returned from Calcutta (Chapter 6), gave lectures in Bengali.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In January 1825, <em>Missionary Sketches</em> featured a ‘Bird’s eye view of the Anglo-Chinese College House at Malacca’, describing its history as well as hopes for its future in Singapore.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Morrison met with Raffles in Britain, hopeful of advancing plans for the Singapore Institution, but Raffles died in England during the summer of 1826, shortly after Morrison returned to China that May.</p>\n<p>Morrison’s library remained at the London Missionary Society until after Morrison died at Canton in 1834, shortly after the East India Company’s trading monopoly in China was abolished. In 1836, shortly after University College London received its royal charter,  it accepted Morrison’s library and appointed a Professor in Chinese.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This was to be Samuel Kidd, a former student of Bogue’s at Gosport Academy who had worked at the Anglo-Chinese College between 1824 and 1832, becoming its principal between 1828.</p>\n<p>In 1922, Morrison’s library was transferred on permanent loan to the newly established School of Oriental Studies, in some ways an updated version of the ‘Universal Language Institution’ Morrison attempted to establish a century earlier. The longer history of Morrison’s library is emblematic of a wider story, by which missionary and evangelical forms of knowledge and education became the basis for institutions, that have, in many cases, persisted into our own times. Morrison’s parallel work on his Chinese Dictionary alongside his Bible translation provides an insight into the ways in which Missionary knowledge itself,was sometimes built on commercial foundations.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Missionary Chronicle for August 1824, <em>Annual Meeting</em>, p.369: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n_EDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA369#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n_EDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA369#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Evangelical Magazine for September 1794, To the Evangelical Dissenters who practice Infant Baptism, p.378: <a href=\"https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024450218?urlappend=%3Bseq=400%3Bownerid=13510798886842978-422\" target=\"_blank\">https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024450218?urlappend=%3Bseq=400%3Bownerid=13510798886842978-422</a> <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Christopher A.

Fuller during the mid-twentieth century, I was surprised to encounter a number of Australian artefacts – four spears and a club. Having briefly worked on a project in northern Australia in 2003, I knew missionaries played a significant part in Australian history, but associated this with other missionary societies and other places.</p>\n<p>The closest the London Missionary Society missions had got to Australia, or so I thought, were the islands of the Torres Strait, lying between Australia’s northeastern tip and Papua New Guinea. Having been sent a scan of Captain Fuller’s personal copy of the <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum,</em> published in the mid-nineteenth century, by the Bishop Museum in Hawai’i, I could see his pencil cross alongside the description for item no. 206, which provides the title for this chapter (he also wrote ‘LM Socy’ in pencil, directly onto the artefact in question – Field Museum accession number 272363 – image above).</p>\n<p>While the London Missionary Society’s longer-term history concentrated in Polynesia, Africa, Madagascar, India, China and the West Indies, its first three decades involved engagements in several other parts of the world. Richard Lovett’s (1899) <em>History of the London Missionary Society 1795-1895</em>, published to mark the Society’s first centenary, is structured around these six major ‘mission fields’, but also includes a chapter on ‘Missions Begun and Abandoned During the Century’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This includes brief accounts of missions to various parts of what is now Canada between 1799 and 1818, to French prisoners of war in 1801, to a brief mission in Buenos Aires in 1807, as well as to Malta and the Ionian Islands of Greece between 1808 and 1844 and Mauritius between 1814 and 1871.</p>\n<p>Listings of missionaries in the appendices of Lovett’s two volumes also include Joseph Frey, a missionary to the Jews in London between 1805 and 1809, and his China section includes an account of the mission to Mongolia between 1818 and 1840. Nowhere, however, does he refer to a mission to the Aboriginal people of Australia. How did such a quintessentially Australian artefact find its way into the collection of the museum of the London Missionary Society, along with a description that at least appears to include the artefact’s name in an indigenous Australian language?</p>\n<p>At least part of the answer has to do with Rev. Daniel Tyerman and George Bennet, the deputation sent by the Directors to tour the Society’s missions in May 1821. Having left them at Raiatea in late 1822, following their return from Hawai’i (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/principal-kinds-of-native-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 7</a>), we need to pick up their strand in the story. Spending time with the Raiatean king, Tamatoa III, they learned about Polynesian mythology as well as the historic significance of the ‘<em>maro’</em>, a hereditary robe of royalty covered with red feathers to which an additional section was added on the accession of each monarch.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Tyerman and Bennet’s account suggests it ‘might be regarded as an hieroglyphic tablet of the annals of Raiatea’, but noted it had been cast off by Tamatoa and sent ‘as another trophy of the gospel victories here to the Museum of the London Missionary Society’ by the resident missionaries John Williams and Lancelot Threlkeld.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> They visited Opoa, centre of the cult of Oro, and former residence of Tamatoa on Raiatea, describing it as the ‘metropolis of idolatry’, which by late 1822 was ‘flourishing in all the unpruned luxuriance of tropical vegetation’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tyerman and Bennet’s described the efforts of the people of Raiatea and surrounding islands to establish a Christian way of life, including through the establishment of law courts that punished even those found guilty of being tattooed, consuming kava or leaving offerings for the deceased, at least initially. At the end of 1822 they witnessed the baptism of 150 people by John Williams and Lancelot Threlkeld, resident missionaries at Raiatea, and in early 1823 they visited the neighbouring island of Taha’a, where they attended the baptism of 198 people, as well as Borabora where they saw 90 more baptised. At Huahine they joined the annual Missionary meeting where a new code of laws was adopted, travelling to Tahiti in mid-May for the annual Missionary meeting, attended by ‘long lines of people… in their various picturesque dresses’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The meeting took place in a chapel so large it needed two preachers, where participants donated considerable amounts of coconut oil, arrow-root, cotton and pigs to support further missionary endeavours.</p>\n<p>Following the death of Pomare II in December 1821, a regency was established – Pomare’s son and heir apparent celebrated his third birthday when Tyerman and Bennet were at Tahiti in June 1823. They seem to have met with various senior men in their attempts to ensure the new Christian order would not fall victim to this seeming power vacuum. In September, when meeting a chief called Tati, they were presented with parts of the ‘bonnet and two tawdry covering which were cast over’ the idol of Oro, as well as a remnant of the ‘<em>maro’</em> used to invest Pomare II as king.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In October, Bennett acquired a <em>fare na atua</em> or god house ‘the only relic of the kind that we have seen in these islands; so utter was the demolition of such things even when the idols themselves were preserved for transportation to England as trophies of the triumph of the gospel’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This example had evidently been hidden by priests in a cave in the mountains, and only recently ‘brought to market and sold’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At the end of October 1823 they went to Mo’orea for six weeks before travelling to Raivavae in the Austral Islands, where they visited newly constructed chapels and witnessed the baptism of 52 people, following which they were presented with a large quantity of bark cloth.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Visiting neighbouring Tubuai in early 1824, they saw more people baptised, despite the island suffering an epidemic disease and having only received Tahitian teachers 18 months earlier.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Returning to Rurutu, where they stopped on their way back from Hawai’i, they attended a church service at which 31 people were baptised. Arriving back at Mo’orea in mid-January and Tahiti in February, Tyerman and Bennet participated in the first Tahitian parliament to include representatives of the common people, convened to consider and adopt a new code of laws. Henry Nott, the Society’s senior missionary, had prepared the laws and presided over the meeting.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While one of the forty articles adopted proposed to repeal the law against tattooing, ‘leaving it to persons to act as they pleased in respect to that custom’, a major point of debate arose over the establishment of a suitable punishment for murder.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> According to the summary given in Tyerman and Bennet’s account, while some suggested they should follow English precedent by adopting the death penalty, others pointed out that the death penalty was also applied in Britain for burglary and sheep stealing, which self-evidently went too far. Scriptural authority was cited, but Tati, a chief who ‘seemed a pillar of state’, pointed out that ‘many of the laws of the Old Testament had been thrown down by the Lord Jesus Christ’, and argued that the New Testament should be their guide.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Pati, the former chief priest of Oro at Mo’orea, who had been the first to burn his <em>to’o</em> (what the missionaries called ‘idols’), pointed out that for Christians, punishment should not be made for revenge but deterrence, suggesting that banishment to a remote island would be more effective in this regard (whether he had the British example of transportation to Australia in mind is unclear). Finally, a commoner argued that another reason for punishment was ‘to make the offender good again if possible’, noting that ‘if we kill a murderer, how can we make him better?’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>With new laws adopted, Tyerman and Bennet, together with the assembled missionaries, presided over the coronation of the infant king on 21 April 1824, the first Christian installation of its kind in Polynesia. The newly adopted code of laws was read to the assembled subjects by Henry Nott and presented to the boy king by George Bennet. Likewise, after he was anointed and crowned by Nott, Daniel Tyerman presented the new King with a Bible, telling him it was ‘the most valuable thing in the world.’ Sailing shortly afterwards to Mo’orea, Tyerman and Bennet prepared to leave for New South Wales in a small (50 ton) schooner, the Endeavour, together with one of the missionaries, Lancelot Threlkeld, who had ‘lately lost his excellent wife’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> On their way, they stopped at the Cook Islands, where they left Tahitian evangelists to continue the work of conversion, visiting a half-built chapel at Rarotonga (see <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>).</p>\n<p>After three years spent largely as guests of honour in the newly Christian kingdoms of Polynesia, established around an explicitly missionary religion, the Deputation’s subsequent visits must have been somewhat anticlimactic. On the way to Australia, the Endeavour stopped at Whangaroa Bay in the far North of New Zealand, where a Wesleyan mission had been established a year earlier. The ship’s deck quickly became crowded with Māori visitors, keen to trade, especially for muskets and gunpowder, New Zealand’s  ‘musket wars’ in the process of transforming Māori political relationships. It seems likely that some of the 34 Māori artefacts that the British Museum acquired from the London Missionary Society were acquired during trading undertaken at this time.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In the midst of these exchanges, the ship’s cook suddenly cried out that his cooking pans had been stolen, and someone else that the Captain’s trunk had been broken into.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Captain John Dibbs attempted to clear the deck, one of the visiting Māori dignitaries was knocked into the water. The women and children immediately left and the Māori men surrounded those Europeans on deck, including Bennet, Tyerman and Threlkeld, together with Threlkeld’s seven year old son. A man who had until then been trading with Bennet began to shout ’Tangata New Zealandi tangata kakino?’ (Is the New Zealand man a bad man?). Having learned some Tahitian, intelligible by New Zealand Māori, Bennet was able to reply ‘Kaore Kakino, tangata New Zealand, tangata kapai’ (Not bad, the New Zealander is a good man).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Despite being threatened with a large axe, brought for sharpening by the ship’s carpenter, Bennet attempted to demonstrate peaceful intentions by allowing himself to be cheated into buying the same fish repeatedly, for fish hooks taken in his jacket pocket.</p>\n<p>Eventually this tension broke when the ship’s boat returned, carrying William White from the Wesleyan mission at Kaeo, together with Te Ara, Principal Chief of Ngati Ura, who defused the situation. Te Ara had himself served on European ships, and his whipping on the Boyd as a crew member is understood to have led to a revenge attack that saw the entire crew killed in Whangaroa Bay, fifteen years earlier. Leaving Te Ara on board to ensure the ship’s safety, Tyerman and Bennet visited the mission station, hopeful that the transformations they had seen in Tahiti would soon come to New Zealand. This, however, was something to be overseen by the Wesleyans, as well as the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) who had established a mission at the Bay of Islands a decade earlier, under the oversight of the Rev. Samuel Marsden, Anglican Chaplain at New South Wales.</p>\n<p>The Endeavour entered Sydney Cove in New South Wales at midnight on 19 August 1824, a little over 54 years after her namesake, HMS Endeavour, arrived at Botany Bay under Captain James Cook. A penal colony had been established in 1788, after American independence meant convicted criminals could no longer be sent across the Atlantic. Free settlers followed in 1793, and by 1824 European settlement extended up to 100km from the harbour.</p>\n<p>Tyerman and Bennet were immediately struck by the stone and brick buildings of Sydney, as well as its two Anglican churches, two Methodist meeting houses, as well as Scotch and Roman Catholic chapels. They couldn’t help but notice the many convicts, however, ‘going about their occupations in jackets marked with the broad arrow, or some other badge of their servile condition. They are, for the most part, miserable creatures…’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Having spent three years with ‘no fear for our persons or our property, by day or night’ they became conscious of the need to ‘look well to ourselves and our locks for security’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Threlkeld would have items stolen on three occasions in the following nine months.</p>\n<p>On 24 August, Tyerman and Bennet visited the Rev. Samuel Marsden at his home in Parramatta (Chapter 4). Having come to Australia before the establishment of the Church Missionary Society  (CMS) in 1799, despite his involvement in directing the efforts of the CMS in New Zealand, Marsden remained a Director of the London Missionary Society and its appointed agent in New South Wales. Marsden introduced the visitors to Sir Thomas Brisbane, Governor of New South Wales since 1821.</p>\n<p>The Deputation visited the factory built nearby for female convicts, but by the end of the month their focus had shifted onto Australia’s indigenous people. Although told by Australian settlers (including Marsden) that earlier attempts to convert and civilise Aboriginal people had demonstrated it to be a hopeless endeavour, Tyerman and Bennet pointed out that the same sentiment had been expressed about the Khoesan peoples of South Africa forty years earlier, among whom there were now thousands of Christians (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a>):</p>\n<p>The Hottentot and Negro have proved themselves men, not only by exemplifying all the vices of our common nature, but by becoming partakers of all its virtues; and that the day of visitation will come to the black outcasts of New Holland also, we dare not doubt.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By 4 September, they were convinced that missionary work should be undertaken in Australia in the same way as it had been in the islands, preaching the gospel to people in their own language. While Aboriginal people had been able to pick up a few phrases in English ‘in mere common-place intercourse with Englishmen’:</p>\n<p>if we wait till they can hear and receive the words of eternal life in any other audible sound than their own, twenty generations may pass over this land of darkness and the shadow of death, before the true light shine upon it; or, which is more probable, the whole aboriginal stock may be extirminated (like the American Indians) by the progress of colonization.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although an Anglican school in the colony was in the process of teaching seven Aboriginal boys while a Methodist school taught seven girls, they asked:</p>\n<p>But what are these out of three millions? One Missionary, learning the language of one tribe, might be able to preach the simple truths of salvation to hundreds and thousands…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>No one, from what they could tell, had made any real effort to attempt to learn Australia’s Aboriginal languages.</p>\n<p>Over a dinner at Marsden’s house on 16 September, they sounded out Governor, Brisbane and the colony’s senior administrators, receiving a degree of support for ‘any prudent measure which might be adopted for ameliorating the condition of the aborigines’. ⁠24 They were told many tales about Aboriginal people, and Tyerman and Bennet’s lobbying efforts, encountered a great deal of resistance, noting that ‘many people who ought to know better are incurably convinced that the New Hollanders are incurably stupid’.⁠25</p>\n<p>They were even told that a prominent land owner at Bathurst had publicly declared that ‘the best use which could be made of “the black fellows” would be, to shoot them all, and manure the ground with their carcases’.⁠26</p>\n<p>For Tyerman and Bennet, opposition to missionary work among settlers must have been familiar and recognisable from other colonial settings, not least South Africa (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a>). Such comparisons were also evidently apparent to others with experience across colonial worlds. At a Missionary Meeting of the Wesleyan Church in early October, the recently appointed solicitor-general of the colony, John Stephen, defended preachers in the West Indies ‘from the cruel calumnies of slave-holders and slave-drivers there’, having previously worked as an attorney in Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 18 October 1824, Tyerman and Bennet met with Governor Brisbane and recommended that Lancelot Threlkeld be appointed as missionary to the Aborigines at the new colony being formed at Moreton Bay on the Brisbane River (Threlkeld had originally planned to return to England to find a wife, but since arriving in New South Wales had met and arranged to marry Sarah Arndell, the daughter of Thomas Arndell, Assistant Surgeon with the first fleet). Tyerman and Bennet had recently met an Englishman who had been wrecked and lived at Moreton Bay, who told them the people were more numerous and ‘of a superior order, to the wretched vagrants here, who are degraded below their original wretchedness by their unhappy intercourse with Europeans’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> On his departure, after two years living among them, he had been given a fishing net and a basket by an old man, so that he could feed himself where he was going.</p>\n<p>The Governor seemed to think that in addition to being a missionary, Threlkeld might act as chaplain at the new settlement, but when told Threlkeld was not a Minister of the Church of England, his attitude seems to have cooled. No space was found for Threlkeld on the ships going to Moreton Bay,  and in December Saxe Bannister, the recently appointed Attorney General, told Threlkeld that they had ‘strong enemies behind the curtain’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 28 December, the anniversary of the arrival of the colony’s previous Governor, Macquarie, Tyerman, Bennet and Threlkeld attended the feast at Parramatta, arranged for the colony’s Aboriginal people, around 400 of whom attended. Some wore red ochre and white clay on their faces as well as necklaces of reed and kangaroo teeth. They were served roast beef and plum pudding, as well as bread and soup, washed down with half a pint of grog.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>With a mission at the new colony at Moreton Bay (Brisbane) ruled out, Tyerman and Bennet looked for an alternative location, settling on Reid’s Mistake, near Newcastle ‘where the natives were numerous and where the fishing tribes could obtain a plentiful supply of fish from Lake Macquarie’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> On 14 January 1825, they sailed around ten hours north from Sydney to see this location, returning four days later to ask the Governor for his approval. On 24 February 1825, Tyerman and Bennet arranged for their instructions to Threlkeld to be printed and circulated in New South Wales. This stated:</p>\n<p>As a knowledge of the language of the Natives must be regarded as essential to the success of your Mission, you will deem it your duty… to be using your best efforts to acquire it; while it will greatly facilitate the progress of your work, to make yourself familiar with their customs, superstitions and habits.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Land was set aside in trust for the mission, and in March Threlkeld returned to Newcastle together with his brother-in-law. After several days of rain, they walked to the place settlers called Reid’s Mistake and spoke with local Aboriginal people about their plans. Returning to Sydney, Threlkeld waited for the arrival of his three daughters from Tahiti, but when they did not arrive in April, returned to establish the new mission in May 1825.</p>\n<p>Threlkeld’s arrival seems to have been welcomed by the Aboriginal population, who invited him to a dance to celebrate.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>After nearly ten months in New South Wales, Tyerman and Bennet arranged to leave in June 1825, with the intention of going on the Society’s missions in Asia. Their stay had been much longer than anticipated, but they felt that ‘circumstances, which appears to be openings of Providence to direct our attention to the perishing and utterly neglected natives of this county, have detained us till this hour’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 21 May 1825, Threlkeld wrote in his journal about ‘a trusty native who speaks good English’. On 26 May the same man took him to a suitable location for the mission, a place name recorded by Threlkeld as ‘Bad debah’ (Bahtabah, now part of suburb of Belmont in the City of Lake Macquarie).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This was the start of a relationship that laid the foundation for Thelkeld’s subsequent work in Australia. The man in question was known as M’Gill (possibly an anglicisation of Magal) and had spent some of his childhood at the military barracks at Sydney.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">36</a></sup> He may have worked at the penal colony at Port Macquarie, but had returned to the Newcastle area by the time Threlkeld arrived. It seems likely that M’Gill directed Threlkeld to establish the mission on land of which he was a traditional custodian.</p>\n<p>Life for Aboriginal people in New South Wales was extremely difficult in the early nineteenth century. Between the many male convicts, who preyed on Aboriginal women and girls, and the settlers, keen to exclude Aboriginal people from their grants of land, there were many dangers and very few legal protections. Magistrates were frequently the very same settlers with whom they were in conflict. Having worked as a ‘bush constable’, M’Gill was no stranger to the violence of the young colony and he seems to have deliberately cultivated Threlkeld as an advocate for his people, while teaching him his language.</p>\n<p>When Threlkeld witnessed an Aboriginal burial shortly after his arrival, he was asked not to tell anyone the location of the grave, since they feared a white fellow would come and take the deceased woman’s head away. Threlkeld connected this to the Maori heads he had seen for sale in Sydney, part of the trade for guns and powder during ‘the musket wars’, but was soon to learn that there was also a trade in Aboriginal heads operating in New South Wales. By spending much of each day in conversation with M’Gill, who he referred to in later years as his Tutor, Threlkeld heard stories and rumours of the deadly violence unfolding across the colony. It was not long before Threlkeld witnessed violent acts himself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In December 1825, Threlkeld was alerted to the sound of an Englishman beating an Aboriginal man, who had tried to stop him abducting his ten year old daughter. When Threlkeld tried to report the assault, his concerns were essentially dismissed by the magistrates. When asked by Saxe Bannister at around the same time about rumours of Aboriginal violence in Hunter River, Threlkeld could only say that he was surprised that ‘more Whites are not speared than there are considering the gross provocation given’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>During the first half of 1826, M’Gill left Threlkeld for several weeks. He went into the mountains to participate in a ceremony, taking with him around 60 spears that he intended to exchange for possum skin cord. According to Threlkeld, he attended a ceremony at around this time ‘which has initiated him into all the rights of an Aborigine’. Despite spending some of his early life among the settlers, M’Gill was in the process of acquiring the authority to act as a leader among his people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At the end of September 1826, Threlkeld and his family moved to the house that had been built for them at the place he now wrote as ‘Ba-ta-ba’, having briefly also written ‘Biddobar’. In April 1827 he arranged for the printing at Sydney of <em>Specimens of A Dialect of the Aborigines of New South Wales; being the first attempt to form their speech into a written language</em>. Threlkeld signs the Preface from ‘Bah-tah-bah’, and the text bears the fingerprints of M’Gill, now increasingly known as Biraban (which appears in the text as Berabahn, translated as Eagle hawk).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By this time, Threlkeld was engaged in a difficult and protracted correspondence with the Directors  of the Missionary Society in London, who had become alarmed at the extremely high costs of establishing this new mission in New South Wales – around £500 a year including clothes, tea, sugar, tobacco and fish hooks paid to Aboriginal people to work at the mission. Thelkeld found that without such inducements they were unlikely to stick around for long, given the lure of nearby Newcastle – evidently a source of plentiful alcohol.</p>\n<p>The Directors suggested that unless the New South Wales government funded some of these expenses, as originally anticipated, Threlkeld should return to the Islands. When his bills were not paid by the Society’s Secretary in London, Threlkeld was arrested at Sydney in November 1827. Concerned at characterisations of his mission as extravagant and ultimately hopeless, Threlkeld attempted to appeal to British History, arguing in a circular he had printed in 1828, that:</p>\n<p>It may be said, with truth, respecting the Aborigines of this land, – treat them as savages, and they will act as savages; – treat them as Men, and they will act as men. We view the conduct of Charactacus, leading the Aboriginal Britons and opposing the invading Romans with applause, and Boadicea, queen of an Aboriginal tribe, with her eighty thousand English slaughtered by insulting conquerors with sympathy. But the Aborigines of Australia, who have no combined numbers, no political power, to render themselves respected, or rather feared, by the invaders of their country, are driven, indirectly, from their districts, as other wild beasts of the deserts, without Sympathy, when the civilized hand cultivates their soil!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although Thelkeld continued his language work while attempting to defend his expenditure, he was informed by a letter he received in December 1828 that the LMS Directors had decided to abandon the mission. They even subsequently instructed Samuel Marsden to place an advertisement in the Sydney Gazette, which declared that the London Missionary Society was discontinuing the Mission at Lake Macquarie, as well as their connection with Threlkeld. Ultimately, the new Governor of the colony, Darling, agreed to support Threlkeld’s mission, although it was relocated to land Threlkeld was granted in a personal capacity on the other side of Lake Macquarie. It became known as the Ebenezer Mission and continued until 1841.</p>\n<p>Was the club, now at the Field Museum in Chicago, collected by Threlkeld during the short years the London Missionary Society supported his mission at Bahtabah? Threlkeld had been actively involved in collecting for the Missionary Museum in the Society Islands, so it is likely he would have continued collecting things in New South Wales. Much later, in 1851, he even took an active part in organising a missionary exhibition in Sydney.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The ‘Tur Rursna’ does not appear in the earliest surviving <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum</em>, but given the long journey between London and New South Wales, it could have arrived soon after the catalogue was published in 1826.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, was it collected by Daniel Tyerman or George Bennet and given to the Missionary Museum together with other items they collected during their deputation? George Bennet returned to Britain in 1829 (Tyerman died in Madagascar in July 1828) and is known to have given a spear thrower, club and shield from coastal New South Wales to the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society (established 1822) as well as a’ Wooden Instrument used by the Aborigines of New Holland, to assist in throwing their Spears’ to the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society (established 1820).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Might the club have been collected by Tyerman and Bennet, and only subsequently connected with the term ‘Tur Rursna’?</p>\n<p>It is hard to be sure of the ultimate origin of the club, but the inclusion of the Aboriginal term <em>Tur Rursna</em> in the later version of the catalogue, published around 1860, remains the best clue we have. The Cuming family collection, assembled in London from 1806 onwards, includes a boomerang acquired around 1840 with an attached label that reads:</p>\n<p>TUR-RUR-MA called by Europeans Boomerang. When thrown into the air, it revolves on its centre and returns, forming a circle in orbit from and to the thrower.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The term ’tur-rur-ma’ had, by then, featured in a list of common nouns given in <em>An Australian Grammar,</em> published by Lancelot Threlkeld at Sydney in 1834. There it was described as:</p>\n<p>An instrument of war, called by Europeans Boomering, of a half moon shape, which when thrown in the air, revolves on its own centre, and returns forming a circle in its Orbit from and to the thrower, to effect which it is thrown against the wind; but, in war it is thrown against the ground which it strikes in its revolution and rebounds apparently with double violence, and strikes at random some distant object, and wounds severely with its sharpened extremities.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Given the closeness of these texts, it seems likely that the information written on the Cuming boomerang came from Threlkeld’s <em>Grammar</em>. Interestingly, a list of names of common places in the same text  includes ‘But-ta-ba’ with the meaning given as ‘The name of a hill on the margin of the lake’. Threlkeld’s introduction to the <em>Grammar</em> makes the case for the kind of detailed linguistic work he was doing with Biraban, partly by including a list of what he calls ‘Barbarisms’ – words pretending to be of Aboriginal origin, but which have likely arisen out of misunderstanding:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Barbarism</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Meaning</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Aboriginal proper word</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Boomiring</td>\n<td>A weapon</td>\n<td>Tur-ra-ma. A half moon like implement used in war.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Waddy</td>\n<td>A cudgel</td>\n<td>Ko-tit-ra</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Woomerrer</td>\n<td>A weapon</td>\n<td>Ya-kir-ri. Used to throw the spear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kangaroo</td>\n<td>An animal</td>\n<td>Ka-rai. Various names</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>While whoever wrote the label for the Cuming Museum had almost certainly seen Threlkeld’s <em>Australian Grammar</em>, this doesn’t necessarily mean it was unrelated to items in the Missionary Museum. In 1839, Henry Syer Cuming wrote to the LMS Directors complaining about the miserable state of the Missionary Museum, offering his services to help in arranging the museum and identifying the localities from which items came if they would remunerate him for his services.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Did he acquire a boomerang for his personal collection in return for his curatorial services, and was it through consulting the Society’s library, containing linguistic works by their former missionary Threlkeld, that he discovered the term <em>Tur-rur-ma</em>?</p>\n<p>It might seem unlikely that Threlkeld would have sent his publications to London given the circumstances in which he was so acrimoniously and publicly dismissed. However, in 1830, William Ellis, who originally left England for the Pacific with Threlkeld in 1816, was appointed Assistant Foreign Secretary of the Missionary Society in London, and in 1832 became its Chief Foreign Secretary (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/13-all-wrapped-up-in-a-piece-of-tahitian-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 13</a>).</p>\n<p>Despite having fallen out with the Society’s Directors, Threlkeld appears to have remained on friendly terms with Ellis, asking him to show the Missionary Museum to several friends visiting London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In 1838, having recently been involved in establishing an Auxiliary society to raise funds for the Society in Australia, Threlkeld suggested that William Westbrooke Burton, a judge at the Supreme Court of New South Wales returning to London on leave, visit the Missionary Museum, where:</p>\n<p>My former colleague the Revd Willm Ellis the Foreign Secretary to the Society will feel much pleasure in giving explanations respecting the many curious articles to be seen at the Society’s Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 23 May 1840, Threlkeld wrote to Ellis from Ebenezer on Lake Macquarie, suggesting that he was making up ‘a packet for the Directors &amp;c &amp;c which I hope to get conveyed by some Captain to the Rooms’. Did this packet include Aboriginal weapons, or did it just include his texts on Aboriginal languages, printed at Sydney?</p>\n<p>At the end of the <em>Annual Report of the Mission to Aborigines, Lake Macquarie</em> for the year 1839, Threlkeld offers a comparison of the dialects spoken by Aboriginal people, which suggests that ‘Tur-rur-ma’ may have been quite a localised term, with even people living inland from Newcastle at Manilla River using a different term:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Lake Macquarie Inlet</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Manilla River</strong></th>\n<th><strong>*Swan River</strong></th>\n<th><strong>*King George’s Sound</strong></th>\n<th><strong>English</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tur-rur-ma</td>\n<td>Pa-run</td>\n<td>Koilee</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>The Boomerang</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>* Dialects taken from a recent work entitled “Australia, an appeal to the World on behalf of the younger branches of the family of Shem.”</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In 1854-55, Threlkeld, then Minister of the Mariner’s Church at Sydney, published a series of ‘Reminiscences’ in <em>The Christian Herald.</em> One, published on 31 March 1855, went under the title <em>Warlike Implements, the Tur-rur-ma, or Boomerang.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Commenting on the biblical prophecy that ‘The nations shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks’,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Threlkeld pointed out that the indigenous people of New South Wales formerly had no metal weapons. The text then describes:</p>\n<p>an instrument of warfare called <em>Yir-ra</em>, in reality, a very simple wooden sword. At first when I saw one, I mistook it for a Boommerang, the shape in the blade being very much like that weapon. There was, however this difference, the Boommerang is alike at both ends, the wooden sword has a handle at one end with a bend contrary to the blade.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Threlkeld draws attention to an image recently published in Joseph Bonomi’s (1852) <em>Nineveh and its Palaces (Figure 42)</em>. This he states:</p>\n<p>is not the <em>Australian</em> Bommereng, but the Australian <em>wooden sword.</em> The difference of shape appears to be only an accidental circumstance arising from the natural growth of the tree whence the wooden sword is taken.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Threlkeld comments on the term ‘Boomerrang’, suggesting ‘The Orthography of this barbarism, for it is not an aboriginal term, but like many others, is a pure invention palmed upon the Blacks, as belonging to their classic lore’. Instead, Thelkeld suggests that ‘the proper aboriginal name’ is <em>Tur-rur-ma,</em> a term he almost certainly learned from Biraban.</p>\n<p>It seems likely that <em>Tur Rursna</em> as it appears in the catalogue of the Missionary Museum is either a misreading of ‘Tur-rur-ma’, written onto a label, or else is one of Threlkeld’s earlier attempts at transcription – like the many different ways in which he wrote the place name Bahtabah.</p>\n<p>Threlkeld’s <em>Reminiscences</em> suggest that the club now at Chicago’s Field Museum is not in fact a <em>Tur-rur-ma</em>, since it clearly has a handle at one end. Neither does it appear to be a <em>Yir-ra</em>, or wooden sword, since its angular profile is unlike the image he identifies as one, nor is it like other early examples recently identified in British museum collections.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fnref53\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">53</a></sup> While we may never definitively know the ultimate origins of this artefact, we can be fairly certain that these words, translations from a living and spoken Aboriginal language into a written form, arose from the friendship Biraban established with Threlkeld on 21 May 1825.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>I am extremely grateful to Gaye Sculthorpe for pointing out that the club is not what Threlkeld called a ‘Yir-ra’, based on her recent work, for providing information on Bennet’s gifts of Australian items to the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society, as well as for connecting me with Daniel Simpson and Eleanor Foster who were working on related areas. I am extremely grateful to Danny for pointing out the use of ‘Tur-rur-ma’ in relation to the Cuming Museum boomerang, now at Saffron Walden, as well as within Threlkeld’s linguistic work. I am grateful to Eleanor for sharing her dissertation, and for her generous acknowledgement of my prior work on this club.</p>\n<p>In the more distant past, I spent the best part of 2003 in Australia, where I learnt a great deal about Australian Aboriginal life from Nicolas Peterson, as well as Howard Morphy at the ANU. It was during that time that I first came across Niel Gunson’s compilation of material on Threlkeld. This chapter is a somewhat late return-prestation, acknowledging the impact that the time I spent in Australia has had on my subsequent work.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Lovett, R. 1899. <em>The History of the London Missionary Society, 1795-1895.</em> Henry Frowde, Volume II.

This conflict underpinned the northern European Reformation of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which Protestantism took shape, and seems to have conditioned the way that LMS missionaries responded to religious ‘idols’, whenever and wherever they were encountered.</p>\n<p>Writing about missionary encounters in the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia, Webb Keane has described this conflict in terms of a clash of semiotic ideologies, suggesting that Protestantism developed a moral narrative of modernity, by which people were understood to be progressively emancipated through their detachment from material forms – a narrative that shaped notions of ‘fetishism’ later in the nineteenth century and arguably continues to underpin contemporary imaginings of secular modernity.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>In many ways it is The Virgin Mary and Child, among all the artefacts listed in the 1826 catalogue, that allows us to unpack the fundamental problem that the London Missionary Society had with ‘idols’ – objects that formed a focus for acts of religious worship – and the reasons these became a dominant focus for missionary collecting during the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>\n<p>Following the re-opening of the Missionary Museum at Austin Friars in August 1824, the considerable costs of ‘building the museum’ (£417) generated concern within the Society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> Should funds raised to support overseas missionary work be used to enable the preservation and display of artefacts in London? Writing from Raiatea in the Pacific on 20 November 1823, the missionaries Lancelot Threlkeld (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/10-two-of-the-tur-rursna/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 10</a>) and John Williams (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>) declared as part of their appeal for a missionary ship:</p>\n<p>Did you know the state of the surrounding islands, how ripe they are for the reception of the gospel, you would sell the very gods out of your Museum, if it were necessary to afford the means of carrying the glad tidings of salvation to those now sitting in darkness.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>A catalogue of the museum’s contents was compiled and printed, sales of which were intended to ‘to diminish the expense incurred by the preparation and support of the Museum’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> The catalogue’s price was not fixed, but left to the ‘liberality’ of museum visitors, with a donations box located in the museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> By May 1825, the Missionary Chronicle reported that this had returned 57 pounds 7shillings and 5 pence.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sadly, there are no known copies of this original 1824 catalogue, but the British Library retains a copy of the slightly later 1826 version.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> This makes it possible to gain a sense of how the collections had grown in the twelve years since John Campbell returned to Britain from South Africa with his giraffe (Chapter 3), as well as many other things, initiating the establishment of the Missionary Museum.</p>\n<p>The title page of the catalogue provides a guide to what may be found in the museum, listing three main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specimens in Natural History</li>\n<li>Various Idols of Heathen Nations</li>\n<li>Dresses, Manufactures, Domestic Utensils, Instruments of War, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is followed by an “Advertisement” providing more background on the museum and its collection, explaining that the articles composing the museum were supplied chiefly by Missionaries of the London Missionary Society, with a few others being donations from ‘benevolent travellers, or friendly officers of mercantile vessels’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> It then explains the three categories of material set out on the previous page, suggesting that:</p>\n<p>The Missionaries rightly judged that the natural productions of the distant countries in which they reside would be acceptable at home, especially to the juvenile friends, and to others who may not have opportunity of viewing larger Collections.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Natural History, although it formed a significant dimension of John Campbells’ original collections, are effectively dismissed as curiosities chiefly of interest to children. It then goes on:</p>\n<p>The efforts also of natural genius, especially in countries rude and uncivilised, afford another class of interesting curiosities; whilst they prove how capable even the most uncivilised of mankind are of receiving that instruction which it is the study of Missionaries to communicate.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>The ‘Dresses, Manufactures, Domestic Utensils and Instruments of War, &amp;c. &amp;C. &amp;c.’, through examples such as finely worked samples of bark cloth brought by William Ellis from Hawaii (Chapter 7), essentially demonstrate potential – a capacity for conversion, but also to be schooled in civilisation – though this argument seems to have concentrated on ‘countries rude and uncivilised’ – which in this context seems to have referred largely to Africa and the Pacific.</p>\n<p>Presumably penned by a professional preacher, the Advertisement altered the order outlined on the title page so that the third category to be described delivers the rhetorical hammer blow in a new paragraph:</p>\n<p>But the most valuable and impressive objects in this Collection are the numerous, and (in some instances) <em>horrible</em> IDOLS_,_ which have been imported from the South Seas Islands, from India, China, and Africa; and among these, those especially which were actually given up by their former worshippers, from <em>a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry</em> – a conviction derived from the ministry of the Gospel by the Missionaries.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup></p>\n<p>Value here is accorded to ‘Idols’ over and above either Natural History or ‘efforts of natural genius’, but special emphasis is given to those given up by their former worshippers, especially when this came from <em>‘a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry’.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>For Protestant evangelicals, the removal of any ‘idols’ may have seemed a good in and of itself, but real value was connected to objects which demonstrated the purpose of the Missionary Society, as set out in its founding constitution of 1795 (Chapter 1):</p>\n<p>The sole object is to spread the knowledge of Christ among the heathen and other unenlightened nations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup></p>\n<p>In this light, ‘idols’ sent to the Missionary Museum by converted ‘heathen’ on the basis of conviction and a change of heart – indicators of sincere conversion – were by far the most valuable and impressive objects in the collection_._</p>\n<p>The <em>Advertisement</em> explicitly connects the display of these ‘singularly interesting objects’ to Pomare’s despatch of his ‘idol gods’ from Tahiti to London in 1816 (Chapter 4), quoting Pomare’s suggestion that missionaries ‘send them to Britain, that the English people might see what foolish gods they had been accustomed to adore’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> In displaying these in their Museum, the Directors of the Society were doing no more than complying with Pomare’s wishes.</p>\n<p>The final paragraph of the <em>Advertisement</em> expresses a desire that these “trophies of Christianity” will:</p>\n<p>inspire the spectators with gratitude to God for his goodness to our native land, in favouring us so abundantly with the means of grace, and the knowledge of his salvation and at the same time, with thankfulness that these blessings have, in some happy degree, been communicated, and by our means, to the distant isles of the Southern Ocean.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup></p>\n<p>The means of grace received in the British Isles by ancestors, generations previously, was connected, as it had been at the foundation of the Society in 1795 (Chapter 1), to the forward extension and communication of these blessings to other parts of the world. The final sentence of the <em>Advertisement</em>, presumably originally written in 1824 suggested:</p>\n<p>Many of the curious articles in the Collection are calculated to excite in the pious mind, feelings of deep commiseration for the hundreds of million of the human race, still the vassals of ignorance and superstition; whilst the success with which God has already crowned our labours, should act as a powerful stimulus to efforts, far more zealous than ever, for the conversion of the heathen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>Keane’s moral narrative of modernity is briefly set out here in grand historical terms for an assumed audience of British Christians – ‘our’ ancestors were vassals of ignorance and superstition but by the grace of God ‘we’ have reached a state of liberation that creates an obligation to liberate others still bound by these same chains.</p>\n<p>A listing of individual items forms the body of the catalogue which follows, but on the final page of the catalogue an appeal for ‘Annual Subscriptions, or Donations, in aid of the Funds of this Society’ is followed by the ‘<em>Form of a Bequest’</em>. This included a blank space for an amount to be entered, allowing visitors whose missionary zeal had been inspired by their visit to the museum provide a legacy for the Society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1826, the Missionary Museum was in the process of being reimagined as an extension of the fundraising work that underpinned all aspects of the London Missionary Society’s operations. The title page and <em>Advertisement</em> establishing a framework through which visitors would be expected to engage with the museum and its collections, categorising and valuing the materials on display, but also providing a narrative in which the visitor – assumed to be not only British, but also Protestant and most likely evangelical, or at least sympathetic – could play a part.</p>\n<p>Prefiguring the secularised narratives of progress that would shape the museums and displays of the later nineteenth century, in relation to what Tony Bennett has called ‘the exhibitionary complex’, this script of liberating Grace has parts for missionaries, supporters, converts as well as idols.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup> But how well do the artefacts listed on the pages of the catalogue play their allotted parts?</p>\n<p>Individual scenes, including Campbell’s giraffe (Chapter 3), Pomare’s idols (Chapter 4) and Ellis’ Hawaiian bark cloth (Chapter 7) appear to conform to these categories, but taken as a whole, how far do the listings of the 1826 catalogue reflect the <em>Advertisment’s</em> exposition?</p>\n<p>Considered in numerical terms, both ‘specimens in Natural History’ (117 listings) and ‘efforts of natural genius’ (323 listings) outnumbered ‘Idols’ (110 listings) among the 550 artefacts listed in the catalogue. Geographically, the largest number came from Africa (163 listings), with twice as many ‘efforts of natural genius’ (111 listings) as ‘specimens in Natural History’ (52 listings), but no ‘Idols’. Next came the Pacific (135 listings), with a good number of ‘Idols’ (45 listings), but still more ‘efforts of natural genius’ (89 listings). This is followed by China (87 listings), with a third as many ‘Idols’ (19 listings) as ‘efforts of natural genius’ (60 listings), although this figure includes quite a number of books (17 listings), such as the Chinese dictionary of Robert Morrison (Chapter 9).</p>\n<p>Other geographical areas, such as Australia (Chapter 10), Madagascar (Chapter 19) and the Americas include far smaller numbers of items (107 combined total listings), but these don’t include any items that can be categorised as ‘Idols’, apart from possibly the PEHI rattle from Demerara (Chapter 5).</p>\n<p>Only among artefacts listed as coming from the ‘East Indies’ (58 listings in total) is there a clear predominance of ‘Idols’ (45 listings). Indeed, the number  of ‘Idols’ is the same as from the Pacific (45 listings), with much smaller numbers of ‘specimens in Natural History’ (6 listings) and ‘efforts of natural genius’ (7 listings). But how far do these ‘Indian idols’ represent what the ADVERTISEMENT called ’valuable and impressive objects… actually given up by their former worshippers, from a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry’?</p>\n<p>Twenty-one of the forty-five ‘Idols’ listed were ‘models’, most likely commissioned by Henry Townley in Calcutta (Chapter 6). Following these in the catalogue is, intriguingly, is a listing for:</p>\n<p>A Case of REJECTED IDOLS from Cuddapah, in the East Indies.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup></p>\n<p>John Hands began preaching and establishing schools at Cuddapah (Kadapa) in 1822, and a mission was established there by William Howell in 1824.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> It seems likely that these items were sent to London when a small number of people were baptised, according to an account published later in the century (1858) ‘from doubtful motives’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n<p>After this, the catalogue includes a fairly large number of items from Rangoon (Yangon – 19 listings), including thirteen Buddhas, two figures of Krishna, a figure of Kali standing on the stomach of Shiva, a stone lingam, and a set of bells from one of the temples. Beginning a listing for the ‘Fourth Shelf’ was a gilt Buddha from Rangoon, described as ‘a Sea Port in the Burmese Empire’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup> This was followed by a long text describing Buddha as an avatar of Vishu, taken from a Sanskrit inscription at Bodh Gaya, translated by Charles Wilkins, which appeared in the first volume of <em>Asiatick Researches, published at Calcutta by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1788.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup></p>\n<p>A very brief mission had been established at Rangoon in 1810, but within months one of the missionaries, J.C. Brain, had died and the other Edward Pritchett returned to Madras. Given how short this unsuccessful mission was, it seems extremely unlikely that all these items could have been collected at that time, especially as it predated the establishment of the Missionary Museum.</p>\n<p>Rather, a hint at the likely source of these items comes from a list of thanks, published in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> of August 1826, stating:</p>\n<p>Also, to Mr. Heritage and others of the Society’s Friends, connected with the Congregation at Union Chapel, Calcutta; for several Burmese Idols (some of which were formerly in the large Pagoda at Rangoon), and other valuable curiosities for the Society’s Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mr Heritage appears to have been a fairly long-term resident of Calcutta, described in 1832 as the Commander of the Hon. Company’s pilot schooner “Henry Meriton”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup> This normally guided vessels on the Hooghly River, between the sea and Calcutta, making Mr Heritage what the <em>Advertisement</em> described as a ‘friendly officer’ of a mercantile vessel. In May 1824, however, this pilot schooner had been equipped with a pair of canons and joined the hastily assembled fleet to transport troops, together with their howitzers, to Rangoon (Yangon) as part of the first Anglo-Burmese war.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup></p>\n<p>The famous golden Shwegadon Pagoda became the military headquarters of the invading troops, who comprehensively pillaged it. It seems likely, therefore that ‘Mr. Heritage and others of the Society’s Friends’ acquired these ‘Burmese Idols’ either as a direct result of their participation in the invasion of Rangoon, or from soldiers returning from the conflict with loot.</p>\n<p>The forced removal of these items as part of military action is not made explicit in the  Missionary Museum catalogue, although the degree to which this implicit provenance would have been understood by those reading the catalogue in the years immediately after the war is unclear. From our perspective, the discrepancy between the display of these items and the ninth commandment – <em>Thou shalt not steal</em> – is striking, but perhaps this was felt to be balanced by the second and third commandments – <em>Thou shalt have no other gods before me</em> and <em>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image</em>.</p>\n<p>After the list of items taken from Rangoon, a short note in the catalogue suggests that:</p>\n<p>In the front of the larger idols are several smaller ones, of silver, brass, copper, and stone: also a curious censer, of spoon for incense.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">29</a></sup></p>\n<p>These likely relate to an early arrival at the museum – back in April 1816 the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> announced that Mr Hands had sent the Directors ‘a number of idols of silver, copper, &amp;c. for their Museum. Also a copy of St. Luke’s gospel, written in leaves: Christ’s Sermon on the Mount, in the Canara language, &amp;c.’ from Bellary [Ballari].<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">30</a></sup></p>\n<p>John Hands began work there in 1810, where he set about translating the Bible into Canarese, so it seems likely the gospel was one on which he had worked. The first convert was only recorded in 1819, however, and the letter he sent with the items in September 1815 explained that ‘he cannot gratify them with an account of the poor Hindus around him having openly embraced the gospel’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup></p>\n<p>With the possible exception of the ‘REJECTED IDOLS from Cuddapah’, neither the idols from Ballary, the looted material from Rangoon, nor the models from Calcutta were given up voluntarily by converts to Christianity. Nevertheless, the catalogue rounded off its listing of Indian ‘Idols’ by reprinting the text which had appeared in <em>Missionary Sketches</em> in 1819, following the descriptions of Townley’s ‘models’  citing Psalm cxv. 5-10: ‘These are specimens, Christian Reader, of the gods of the heathen in India worshipped by more than a hundred millions of deluded people. These are the creatures of a corrupt imagination, and the workmanship of men’s hands…’.</p>\n<p>Following this, a paragraph from Ward’s <em>Account of the Writings, Religion, and Manners of the Hindoos including Translations from their Principal Works</em> was printed in the catalogue:</p>\n<p>Nine-tenths of the whole Hindu population pay no conscientious regard whatever to the forms of their religion, and yet the various cruelties accompanying their superstitions occasion the death of more than ten thousand persons every year. And notwithstanding the veneration in which some pretend to hold their gods, yet many, especially the poor, take the liberty of abusing them. When it thunders awfully, respectable Hindoos say, “Oh! the gods are giving us a bad day;” the lower orders say, “The rascally gods are dying.” During a heavy rain, a woman of respectable class frequently says, “Let the gods perish! my clothes are all wet.” A man of low castes says, “These rascally gods are sending more rain.” Ward. vol.1 p.xc</p>\n<p>Red shows ‘Idols’, dominating the Indian collections in particular, Blue shows ‘Natural History’ while ‘Green’ shows everything else (efforts of natural genius)</p>\n<p>Here Green shows ‘Natural History’ and Red shows ‘Idols’ but other colours are allocated to the other categories listed on the Catalogue’s title page (Dresses, Manufactures &amp; Domestic Utensils, Instruments of War), while an additional category has been added for ‘Publications’, which demonstrates how significant these were as part of the collection from China.</p>\n<p>Two lines, one thick, mark an ending of sorts for the ‘EAST INDIES’ section of the <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum</em>, but in the remaining space of the page follows the description with which this chapter began:</p>\n<p>THE VIRGIN MARY AND CHILD, from Mysore, that belonged to two Native Roman Catholics, who embraced the Christian religion, and sent the same to the Missionary Society</p>\n<p>Beneath this a further paragraph appears in quotation marks:</p>\n<p>“The people were in great consternation at the removal of the image, and offered large sums of money for it; one offered twenty pagodas, another his daughter, and another even declared he would sell his own child and procure money enough to purchase it, if it might be retained; but a deaf ear was turned to the proposals, being aware of the danger of making it an object of worship, and felt as the disciples of Christ,- constrained to take it away.” <em>Vide Missionary Chronicle for January 1826</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">32</a></sup></p>\n<p>Given that the publication referred to appeared in the same year as the <em>Catalogue</em> was printed, I initially wondered whether the inclusion of this text after the thick black line suggested an addition to an already prepared printing block. However, given that the items from Rangoon were reported even later in the same year (August), but were incorporated into the main section of the East Indies section, I now think that the lines serve to deliberately demarcate a Christian ‘idol’ from the ‘heathen’ idols that preceded it.</p>\n<p>The paragraph in quotes comes from a printed version of a letter, originally sent to the Society’s secretary on 23 July 1825 and signed by the London Missionary Society’s three European missionaries at Bangalore, Hiram Chambers, William Campbell and Stephen Laidler. It explained:</p>\n<p>We are permitted at this time to lay before you, two trophies of the victorious power of divine truth over the delusions of the Antichrist; trophies which we hope and trust may prove powerful auxiliaries in making known Christ and Him crucified, to their perishing fellow-men.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fnref33\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">33</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Antichrist was not a gruesome Heathen deity, but rather the Catholic Church, and the two ‘trophies’ were not ‘idols’, but rather two young men who had converted to Protestant Christianity and who, it was hoped, would play a part in converting others. Christianity’s roots in south India are believed to go back to the arrival of St Thomas the apostle in the first century, but the roots of Catholicism in Mysore are generally traced to the establishment of a Mysore mission by Father Leonardo Cinnami in 1649.</p>\n<p>Following a visit to Bangalore (Bengaluru) by John Hands, from his mission station at Bellary (Ballard), 300km away, Stephen Laidler had established a mission there for the LMS in 1820. With access to the Indian town prohibited to European missionaries by the Rajah of Mysore, preaching was initially directed at the Europeans and Sepoys in the military cantonment. This seems to have changed, however, after the arrival at the mission of Samuel Flavel, who actively preached in surrounding villages, distributing tracts and copies of the gospels in local languages.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fnref34\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">34</a></sup></p>\n<p>Born at Quilon (Kollam) on the Malabar Coast of Kerala in 1787, Shunkurulingam, as he was known before he was baptised, was employed by a British officer at a fairly young age. He travelled widely in India, visiting Mauritius before being employed in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) as a butler. He came across a translation of the Gospels into Tamil which initiated a personal quest to know more about Protestant Christianity. This led to his baptism at Tellicherry (Thalassery) by an East India Company chaplain, when he adopted the name Samuel. Invited by Laidler to join the new mission at Bangalore, Samuel became central to its work. He was ordained as the pastor of the native church in 1822, when he adopted the surname Flavel at Laidler’s suggestion. John Flavel, like his Indian namesake, had been a learned Puritan minister, famous for preaching in the face of official prohibition.</p>\n<p>The letter, written at Bangalore in July 1825, and printed in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> in January 1826, concerns an event that took place in the city of Mysore (Mysuru), with none of the three European missionaries present. Samuel Flavel had made the journey of nearly 150km at the invitation of two brothers who were catechists at the city’s Roman Catholic Church.</p>\n<p>Five years previously they had talked with Joshua, an Indian convert connected to the London Missionary Society, which led them to question Catholic practice. The elder of the two was, according to the account given, flogged by the priest for his impertinence – an example of what the letter refers to ‘the carnal weapons of Antichrist’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fnref35\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">35</a></sup></p>\n<p>Visited in April 1824 by another Indian convert, John, who had recently been baptised at Bangalore, the elder brother wrote to Flavel, asking for a meeting. Flavel told the European missionaries that when he arrived in Mysore, the Catholic congregation had been commanded by the priest not to speak to him, who described him as ‘the greatest devil he had known among the Protestants’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">36</a></sup></p>\n<p>The congregation reportedly tried to persuade the two brothers, whose father had been a Catholic, not to leave the church, offering to double their allowance as catechists. Unpersuaded, the letter suggests they were ‘treated with great contempt and abuse’, and given a kicking, which was ‘received as became the disciples of the meek and lowly Jesus’, praying for their attackers. The younger brother was accused by the crowd of saying they were the “Antichrist”, to which he replied that beating and flogging the pair received ‘fully proved that <em>they</em> deserved that name.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fnref37\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">37</a></sup></p>\n<p>The brothers then went to the Catholic Church ‘with a view to removing some images which were their private property, and which had formerly belonged to their father’, destroying all except that of the Virgin Mary.</p>\n<p>This had been embellished with jewels by ‘infatuated devotees’, especially one woman who believed Mary ‘had been propitious to her’. The congregation claimed the jewels as the property of the church, attempting to persuade the brothers to accept payment for statue, arguing that ‘if it were taken away, some curse would descend upon the congregation’ – some of the details of their offers were summarised in the paragraph that was quoted in the catalogue of the Missionary Museum.</p>\n<p>Turning a deaf ear, however, they:</p>\n<p>endeavoured to demonstrate with the poor infatuated people, showing the folly and sin of these offers, assuring them that they did not refuse their offers because the expected more money for it; but being aware of the danger of making it an object of worship, they felt, as the disciples of Christ, constrained to take it away.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fnref38\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">38</a></sup></p>\n<p>When they did so they were charged with further debts which were subsequently dismissed by a magistrate. Baptised by Samuel Flavel, they took the names Nathaniel<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fnref39\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">39</a></sup> and Jonas and travelled with him to Bangalore, presumably taking the statue of the Virgin Mary and infant Jesus with them.</p>\n<p>According to the letter signed by the three European missionaries, this was:</p>\n<p>the plain unvarnished tale of the conversion of these two men from the errors and superstitions of the Church of Rome, to the profession of the truth as it is in Jesus.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fnref40\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">40</a></sup></p>\n<p>Here, at last, was an ‘idol’ unambiguously ‘given up by former worshippers, from a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry’ in the East Indies section of the catalogue of the Missionary Museum. Rather than being a Hindu <em>murti</em> or Buddharūpa, however, it was an image of the Virgin Mary. It may have been given up through ‘a conviction derived from the ministry of the Gospel by the Missionaries’ although these Missionaries were not Europeans, but fairly recent Indian converts.</p>\n<p>The following month, in February 1826, the editors of the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> returned to the Bangalore mission, printing another letter from the same three missionaries sent slightly earlier, on 15 May 1825. This described an encounter between Samuel Flavel and an Indian Catholic from Madras. Evidently ‘all that Samuel said was well received, till he spoke against praying to the Virgin Mary and departed saints’. The two men agreed to have a public disputation in the bazar, for which Samuel proposed four questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the faith of the Roman Catholic church the faith of the church of Christ?</li>\n<li>Is the church of Rome the church of Christ?</li>\n<li>Are its ceremonies, – such as bowing to the priests with their faces to the ground, counting their beads, and wearing crosses round their necks, the ceremonies of the church of Christ?</li>\n<li>Are its acts of worship,- such as bowing to images, ringing of bells, &amp;c. – lawful in the church of Christ?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fnref41\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">41</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Their conversations were evidently attended by sixty or seventy people, many of whom are referred to as ‘heathens’, and their meetings continued over more than a fortnight. According to the letter, the seriousness with which these events were approached made the European missionaries at Bangalore think:</p>\n<p>of the contests which, in the days of Luther and of Calvin, produced such effects in the western world; and we rejoiced in the hope that this might prove a commencement of the more certain and speedy overthrow of Antichrist in this distant land.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fnref42\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">42</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the translation and summary of the dialogue that was printed, the disputation centred on the accuracy of the translation of the second commandment, relating to graven images, with Flavel exclaiming that:</p>\n<p>I believe, then, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; that he is the only Mediator between God and Man; that he is the way, the truth, and the life; that he is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him; and that he is the only Advocate who intercedes for us at the right hand of his Father.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fnref43\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">43</a></sup></p>\n<p>When challenged on the difference between worshiping and looking at images, Flavel’s Catholic interlocutor suggested that Protestant bibles also included pictures of Jesus Christ. Flavel’s counter was to volunteer to burn these images and say he rejected them if his interlocutor was prepared to do the same for Catholic images.</p>\n<p>The letter ends its account of the dialogue by stating that it was an imperfect translation ‘as Samuel speaks his own language not only very correctly, but often with elegance and eloquence’ – revealing the severe linguistic limitations that held back the preaching efforts of European missionaries in other parts of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fnref44\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">44</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is significant that both letters sent from Bangalore in 1825 end by outlining plans for Mysore College, a seminary that was intended to bring ‘forward pious native youth for the ministry of the gospel’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fnref45\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">45</a></sup> The degree to which the London Missionary Society would support and embrace local Christian teachers, such as Samuel Flavel, would become a defining question for the Directors of the London Missionary Society, back in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fnref46\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">46</a></sup></p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>An earlier version of this chapter appeared in the Südasien-Chronik – South Asia Chronicle, together with Chapter 6, under the title ‘South Asian Artefactual Histories from the London Misisonary Society Museum, 1814-1826’. I am very grateful to Tobias Delfs for the invitation to contribute to the special issue of the journal on Christian mission in South Asia.</p>\n<p>As someone who is not a specialist on South Asia, I have been cautious venturing into this field, but in writing these artefactual histories I realised I had probably learnt more from tutorials in Oxford with Nicholas Allen and Clare Harris, as well as lectures by Richard Gombrich, than I had remembered. I am grateful for my education in South Asian religion and would like to mark Nick’s passing in 2020.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2t86AQAAMAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical%20magazine%20and%20missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA308#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2t86AQAAMAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical magazine and missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA308#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p><em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum, Austin Friars</em>. 1826.

Mary, his wife, bailed water continuously as others rowed them ashore.  Landing on the beach, John described what he saw as ‘the greatest concourse of people I had seen since we left England’.  It being a Sunday, worshippers were leaving their chapel, the women dressed in white bark cloth and bonnets, the men in clothes ‘of native manufacture’ and hats.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mary and John Williams had come to assist Charles and Elizabeth Pitman to establish their mission on the island. The Pitmans had crossed paths with George Bennet and Daniel Tyerman at New South Wales in 1825 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/10-two-of-the-tur-rursna/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 10</a>), who directed them to Rarotonga. Tyerman and Bennet visited the island on their way to Sydney in June 1824, describing its chapel as ‘half finished’ and the people as ‘gentle, upright, and well behaved, attending with diligence to the means of grace, and daily making progess in the arts of civilised life’.⁠2</p>\n<p>Three days after the arrival of the Pitmans and the Williams, the ship on which they had arrived left because of the rough sea. The following day, the whole community of between two and three thousand people walked to another settlement on the eastern side of the island. Several Rarotongans, including Makea, the <em>ariki</em> (chief or king) at Avarua, offered to carry the many curious possessions brought by the recently arrived Europeans. On arrival at Ngatangiia, they discovered a pair of recently constructed houses, built for Papeiha and Tiberio, preachers from the Society Islands who had lived at Rarotonga for the previous four years. One of these houses was given up for the new arrivals. According to John Williams’ description, published a decade later, in 1837:</p>\n<p>A day or two afterwards, they requested us to take our seat outside the door; and on doing so, we observed a large concourse of people coming towards us, bearing heavy burdens. They walked in procession, and dropped at our feet fourteen immense idols, the smallest of which was above five yards in length. Each of these was composed of a piece of <em>aito</em>, or iron-wood, about four inches in diameter, carved with rude imitations of the human head at one end, and with an obscene figure at the other, wrapped around with native cloth, until it became two or three yards in circumference. Near the wood were red feathers, and a string of small pieces of polished pearl shells, which were said to be the <em>manava</em>, or soul of the god. Some of these idols were torn to pieces before our eyes; others were reserved to decorate the rafters of the chapel we proposed to erect; and one was kept to be sent to England, which is now in the Missionary Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In Williams’ (1837) book, <em>A Narrative of Missionary Enterprises</em>, there is an image on the page after this description, showing what is described by a caption as ‘<em>One of the national idols’</em>, wrapped in layers of bark cloth, alongside its string of shells, or <em>manava,</em> captioned as the ’<em>Soul of the idol</em>’. Empty space on the page is filled by a sketch of ‘<em>The Fisherman’s god</em>’, also from Rarotonga. This ‘Fisherman’s god’, now in the British Museum (<a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/E_Oc-LMS-36\" target=\"_blank\">Oc,LMS.36</a>), appears to have been emasculated, though whether this happened in Rarotonga is unknown.</p>\n<p>Similarly, just as Williams did not describe the ‘obscene figure’ at the bottom of the ancestral pole, known in the Rarotonga language as <em>ki’iki’i</em>, the image in his book avoids showing the phallus with which the twelve foot long pole originally terminated. Whether this had also been removed is unclear.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>  In his text, however, Williams notes that:</p>\n<p>It is not, however, so respectable in appearance as when in its own country; for his Britannic Majesty’s officers, fearing lest the god should be made a vehicle for defrauding the king, very unceremoniously took it to pieces; and not being so well skilled in making gods as in protecting the revenue, they have not made it so handsome as when it was an object of veneration…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Described as ‘A Gigantic Idol’ in the catalogue of the Missionary Museum, printed around 1860, which provides this chapter’s title, it stood at the centre of the Missionary Museum for many decades (under the north skylight according to the catalogue), rivalling and ultimately eclipsing John Campbell’s South African Giraffe (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a>). Images of the missionary museum suggest that unlike the image in Williams’ book, its bark cloth wrappings were wider at the bottom than the top, presumably a consequence of its disassembly by British custom officers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>A few days after the performance of iconoclasm described by Williams, several thousand people assembled for Sunday worship. Half of them had to sit outside the building which served as their temporary chapel. Over the next two months, the entire community worked together to construct a new place to worship. According to Williams, it was ultimately:</p>\n<p>one hundred and fifty feet in length, and sixty wide; well plastered, and fitted up throughout with seats… It was a large, respectable, and substantial building; and the whole was completed without a single nail, or any iron-work whatever. It will accommodate nearly three thousand persons.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The script for this tale of conversion – the destruction of religious ‘idols’, the adoption of new forms of dress and the building of a new church, overseen from a distance by European missionaries, recapitulates the image produced for <em>Missionary Sketches</em> in July 1819, where it illustrated the conversion of Tahiti under Pomare II (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>). Given that no Europeans had lived at Rarotonga for any length of time before May 1827, it seems safe to assume that at least part of this script was compatible, or at least comprehensible, in terms of existing Polynesian religious practices.</p>\n<p>Nearly two centuries after the event that was depicted on the title page of John Williams’ (1837) <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises,</em> above a quotation from Isaiah ii, 18 declaring  ‘And the idols he shall utterly abolish’, how should best can we understand the conditions that prompted this performance of conversion?</p>\n<p>John and Mary Williams had arrived in the Pacific ten years earlier, on 17 November 1817, together with four other missionary couples. Inspired by news of Pomare’s ‘overthrow of idolatry at Tahiti’ (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>), they formed part of a significant reinforcement for the, by then, fairly depleted first generation of European missionaries (four of whom had arrived in the Duff in 1797 and the other four in the Royal Admiral, a convict ship, in 1801).</p>\n<p>These additional recruits made it possible to expand European influence beyond the small island of Mo’orea, where British missionaries had stayed for much of the previous decade, sending despatches to London during Pomare’s reconquest of Tahiti including, in 1816, his ‘Idol Gods’  (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>).</p>\n<p>By 1817, the destruction of <em>marae</em> (religious ceremonial enclosures) and the burning of <em>to’o</em> (spiritual vessels) and <em>ti’i</em> (religious sculptures) had spread far beyond Papetoai on Mo’orea, where Pati’i, a priest, first burnt items he was responsible for in 1815. By the middle of the following year, requests for European teachers had arrived from the Leeward islands of Huahine, Ra’iatea, Taha’a and Borabora, where ‘idols’ had also been destroyed and churches constructed. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Former students of the missionary school at Papetoai played a key role in taking new practices of reading and praying (converts were initially known as <em>Bure Atua</em> or prayers to God) to the Leeward Islands. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>They were assisted by Tamatoa, ruler of Ra’iatea, one of Pomare’s key allies. By 1816, Tamatoa had overcome Fenuapeho, his rival on the neighbouring island of Taha’a, who attempted to defend the existing religious system.</p>\n<p>Since the capture of the Duff in 1799, however, European missionaries had been dependent on others if they wanted to travel by sea.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In March 1817, the newly arrived mission printing press was transported, together with a number of missionaries, in the canoes of Vara, chief of Afareaitu in the east of Mo’orea.</p>\n<p>A start had been made on building a missionary ship, but it was the arrival of a mariner, Captain Nicholson, sent with the new missionaries from London, which prompted the completion of this vessel, a seventy ton brig. Its launch was arranged for 7 December 1817, but when Pomare II threw a bottle of red wine and declared <em>Ia ora na oe e Haweis</em> (Prosperity to you, O Haweis), naming the ship after his principal benefactor in Britain, the smashing glass so alarmed those holding her ropes that they let go, and the Haweis toppled onto her side.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Righted, she was subsequently launched.</p>\n<p>Missionaries were taken to re-establish stations on the main island of Tahiti at Papara, Papaoa and Puna’auia in Atehuru (called Burder’s Point by the missionaries, after the Secretary of the Society in London), as well as at Matavai, the original location of the mission (Chapter 1), abandoned since 1809. In mid-1818, the Haweis transported Ellis, Williams and Threlkeld to Huahine in the Leeward Islands, together with their wives and a printing press.</p>\n<p>In September of that year, Williams and Threlkeld persuaded the <em>Active,</em> purchased by Samuel Marsden in 1814 to supply his Church Missionary Society mission at New Zealand, to take them to Ra’iatea together with Tamatoa. Having received numerous requests for books from Paumonaa and Tifai, former pupils at the missionary school at Papetoai, they went to provide support and oversight.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Under Williams and Threlkeld, as well as for John Orsmond until he left for Bora Bora in 1820, Ra’iatea became an alternative (and rival) centre of missionary operations. All three were zealous missionary recruits of the new generation, suspicious of the compromises arrived at by the older Tahitian missionaries. In a letter written to the Directors in July 1822, following the death of Pomare II, Williams and Threlkeld declared:</p>\n<p>Not one native in this Island (Ra’iatea), whose conduct is at all consistent with the Gospel, laments his loss, but rather consider it interposition of God in removing him, in short his whole aim was to grasp at all of the Islands under the pretence of Christianising them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Orsmond, in a somewhat embittered letter sent to England after he was dismissed from the LMS in 1849, described Pomare as ‘a beastly sot’:</p>\n<p>The King changed his Gods, but he had no other reason but that of consolidating his Government. After his conquest it is true he went by short stages to shew his authority, receive presents from his newly acquired subjects, drink the abundance of native spirits, and then in their inebriety, cast down their Marae and destroy their Gods, thus by strategem taking away from any future rebellion thro the power of the idols which were always leaders in war.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The early years at Ra’iatea were spent building houses, chapels and bridges, including some on the neighbouring island of Taha’a.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Williams’ appeal to supporters in Birmingham prompted a donation to assist his work, including:</p>\n<p>two Casks, one containing Nails only, the other, Nails, Hammers, Bench Vices, Nippers, Pincers, Saws, Printing Ink and various other Articles<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>[^In May 1819, an auxiliary Missionary Society was established with Tamatoa as president.⁠17]</p>\n<p>Puna, one of these who spoke at the meeting described the Missionary Society as like the wind:</p>\n<p>that makes the heavy ships sail… If there had been none, no ship would have come here with Missionaries. If there is no property, how can Missionaries be sent to other countries, how can the ships sail? Let us then give what we can.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tuahine, added:</p>\n<p>Whence comes the great waters? Is it not from the small streams that flow into them… I have been thinking that the Missionary Society in Britain is like the great water, and that such little Societies as ours are like the little streams. Let there be many little streams: let not ours be dry. Let missionaries be sent to every land. We are far better off now than we used to be. We do not now sleep with our cartridges under our heads, our guns by our sides, and our hearts in fear…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tuahine’s comments capture a sense that the adoption of Christianity was associated with an end to hostilities and the establishment of peace, but this entailed accepting the authority of the leaders who embraced the new religion such as Pomare II at Tahiti and Tamatoa at Ra’iatea.</p>\n<p>In March 1821, a canoe arrived at Ra’iatea from Rurutu in the Austral Islands, 560km to the South, where disease had recently decimated the population. Au’ura, leader of the group, was deeply interested by Christian practices, learning to read during the time he spent at Ra’iatea. Four months later, the arrival of a ship, the <em>Hope</em>, tested the Ra’iateans’ commitment to supporting missionary activity by providing an opportunity for the thirty people who had come from Rurutu to return. Au’ura, however, stated that he didn’t wish to return to his ‘land of darkness without a light in his hand’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Puna and Mahamene volunteered to go with him, together with their wives, supported by the congregation at Ra’iatea. Along with bark cloth, food, spelling books and gospels, they were given ‘various useful tools’ including razors, knives and scissors. Lancelot Threlkeld arranged for his personal boat to be towed by the <em>Hope,</em> so that it could return with news. He also wrote to London stating:</p>\n<p>the Chief [Au’ura] promises their Gods to you we reccommend [sic] him not to burn them but send them prisoners to the Society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In a letter also sent in the <em>Hope</em> to the Directors, Tamatoa explained that he had covered up his own ‘evil spirits_’_ with the intention of sending them to London, but when he fell ill:</p>\n<p>some men said to me that I had taken care of the evil spirits, and that was the reason I was overtaken with sickness; I was requested by the people to burn the evil spirits, and I said Burn them, <em>Oro e a Hiro</em> were the two evil spirits that were burned.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In August 1821, Threlkeld’s boat arrived back at Ra’iatea with letters from Au’ura, Puna and Mahamene, carrying what John Williams described as ’prisoners, the gods of the heathen, taken in this bloodless war, and won by the blood of Him who is Prince of Peace’. A letter sent by Puna and Mahamene described a meeting of ‘the chiefs and king’ at Rurutu when Au’ura proposed that ’the evil spirit be this instant cast into the fire’, suggesting that God had guided him to Ra’iatea ‘where the teachers are’. According to this letter, two men started up ‘inspired by the evil spirit’, stating ‘I have seen the foundation of the firmament, up in the sky. Taaroa brought me forth.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Auura then answered the evil spirit thus, ‘Do you leap up then, that we may see you flying up into the sky. Do so now, immediately. Truly thou art even the very foundation of deceit. The people of Rurutu have been completely destroyed through you, and through you alone, and now you shall not deceive us again…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Puna then advised the assembled men:</p>\n<p>prepare one place where you may all eat together, you and your wives and children, and your king, at one eating place, and there the evil spirit who has just now inspired that man shall be completely ashamed: he has no refuge; but cast away every disgraceful thing from among you, for that is the reason he remains among you.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When communal eating prompted no apparent ill effects, the people of Rurutu ‘boldly seized the gods, and then proceeded to demolish totally the Morais [Maraes], which was all completely effected that day.’ Puna and Mahamene then oversaw the construction of a Chapel, in which Tyerman and Bennet noticed old spears being used ’to support the balustrade of the pulpit staircase’ in November 1822.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The evening that Threlkeld’s boat arrived back at Ra’iatea, a meeting was held in the chapel, lit by a great many cocoa nut shell lamps. The evangelists’ accounts from Rurutu were shared and the ‘idols’ exhibited from the pulpit. According to Williams:</p>\n<p>One in particular, Aa, the national god of Rurutu, excited considerable interest; for, in addition to his being bedecked with little gods outside, a door was discovered at his back; on opening which, he was found to be full of small gods; and no less than twenty-four were taken out, one after another, and exhibited to public view. He is said to to be the ancestor by whom their island was peopled, and who after death was deified.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tuahine, one of the deacons at the church remarked:</p>\n<p>Thus the gods made with hands shall perish. There they are, tied with cords! Yes! their very names also are changed! Formerly they were called ’<em>Te mau Atua,’</em> or the gods; now they are called ’<em>Te mau Varu ino,’</em> or evil spirits: Their glory, look! It is bird’s feathers, soon rotten; but our God is the same for ever.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Another speaker observed:</p>\n<p>Look at the chandeliers! Oro never taught us any thing like this! Look at our wives, in their gowns and their bonnets, and compare ourselves with the poor natives of Rurutu, when they were drifted to our island, and mark the superiority! And by what means have we obtained it? By our own invention and goodness? No! It is to the good name of Jesus we are indebted. Then let us send this name to other lands, that others may enjoy the same benefits.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Religion clearly remained a material business for many members of the congregation at Ra’iatea. The wrapping of Christian women in gowns and bonnets could be read as advancement, just as the unwrapping and burning of ‘gods made with the hands’ marked a devaluation. Nevertheless, it is significant that the translated remarks of both Tamatoa and Tuahine refer primarily to ‘spirits’ rather than to ‘idols’, a Biblical term used mostly by European missionaries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/works/uue7tp4t\" target=\"_blank\">‘Idols’ worshipped by the Inhabitants of the South Sea Islands</a></p>\n<p>Printed to face the title page of Volume 2 of William Ellis (1829) _Polynesian Researches (_London: Fisher, Son &amp; Jackson).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/works/uue7tp4t\" target=\"_blank\">Wellcome Collection EPB/B/21643/1.v2</a></p>\n<p>Earlier religious practices involving <em>marae, to’o</em> and <em>ti’i</em> appear to have provided the means to manifest and communicate with immaterial spiritual entities – just as printed Bibles embodied the immaterial word of God, and newly built Chapels housed congregations through which the Holy Spirit could act on earth. Describing <em>ti’i</em> (carvings representing spirits) and <em>to’o</em> (pieces of hard wood representing national or family gods), following conversations with a maker of such things at Ra’iatea, William Ellis suggested that:</p>\n<p>Into these they supposed the god entered at certain seasons, or in answer to the prayers of the priests. During this indwelling of the the gods, they imagined even the images were very powerful: but when the spirit had departed, though they were among the most sacred things, their extraordinary powers were gone.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Early nineteenth century Evangelical Christianity, with its emphasis on opening oneself to and accepting, the redeeming power of divine Grace must have been immediately comprehensible to people whose existing religious practices also concerned the channeling divine power in the world, even if they called this <em>mana</em> rather than Grace. This sense of recognition appears to have been mutual, William Ellis declaring:</p>\n<p>it is impossible not to feel interested in a people who were accustomed to consider themselves surrounded by invisible intelligences, and who recognised in the rising sun – the mild and silver moon – the shooting star – the meteor’s transient flame – the ocean’s roar – the tempest’s blast, or the evening breeze – the movements of mighty spirits.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In October 1821, John and Mary Williams traveled to New South Wales in the <em>Westmoreland</em>, a visiting ship, for health reasons.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Inspired by what had recently taken place at Rurutu, Williams proposed taking further members of his congregation to serve as missionaries at Aitutaki, in what is now the Cook Islands. Members of the Church selected two of their number, Papeiha and Vahapata, for this work.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At Aitutaki, ‘the Chief’, also called Tamatoa, joined them on deck. When told about the conversion of Tahiti and the Society Islands, he asked about the fate of ‘great <em>Tangaroa’,</em> as well as ‘Koro of Raiatea’ [presumably Oro] and was told that both had been burned.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He agreed that Papeiha and Vahapata could remain on the island, and it was in the course of this conversation that Williams learned that Rarotonga, of which he had heard much in Ra’iatea, was relatively close at hand.</p>\n<p>Williams, who had recently inherited property from his late mother, purchased a vessel at Sydney, the <em>Endeavour</em>, intended to trade tobacco and sugar with the colony on behalf of Tamatoa and other leaders in the islands.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Williams recruited John Dibbs, second officer of the <em>Westmoreland</em>, to command this ship, which he also planned to use to deliver missionaries to surrounding islands.</p>\n<p>Williams returned to Ra’iatea stocked with shoes, stockings, tea-kettles, tea-cups and saucers, as well as tea, hoping that by encouraging tea consumption he could persuade the islanders to grow more sugar. Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales also gave cows, calves and sheep to the chiefs and missionaries, as well as two ensigns (British maritime flags) and a pair of church bells.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In April 1822, while still at Sydney, Williams received letters from Papeiha and Vahapata at Aitutaki, telling him that a number of people originally from Rarotonga had embraced their teachings, and wished to return to their own island. Stopping at Rurutu in May, on the way back to Ra’iatea, Williams found a chapel filled with people wearing bonnets and hats, many of whom had learned to read, as well as plastered houses for the teachers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In mid-1823, following the return of the <em>Endeavour</em> from her first trading voyage to Sydney, Williams sailed to Aitutaki with Robert Bourne, as well as four couples from the congregation at Ra’iatea who had volunteered as missionaries, and one from Taha’a.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> They intended to find Rarotonga, but also to leave teachers at other nearby islands. On board the <em>Endeavour,</em> Williams created a letter of instruction for the Polynesian missionaries. The advice it contains suggests he recognised that there was a fine balance to be struck between encouraging the overthrow of existing practices and communicating the good news of Christian salvation, alongside the advantages of new technical skills:</p>\n<p>Remember that this work is the work of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is not to prosper by the strength of man. The Holy Spirit must do the work. Without him, it will not grow…</p>\n<p>Do not let the whole of your discourses be directed against the evil spirit; but exalt our Lord Jesus Christ and his Gospel. Tell fully of his great compassion to us, and of the efficacy of his blood to cleanse and save the soul…</p>\n<p>All their lesser evil customs, such as going naked, cutting and scratching themselves in seasons of grief, tattooing their bodies, eating raw fish, &amp;c. you will endeavour to cast down; but the greater evils will require your first efforts, and then the smaller…</p>\n<p>Have good houses yourselves, and all the little concerns within them, let them be good also… Teach them all you know – to build houses, to do carpentering work, to plaster, and to make bedsteads and seats, to make oil and arrow-root… Your wives also, let them teach the women to sew, to make bonnets, mats, cloth, &amp;c., that they may appear decent….</p>\n<p>If you obtain idols, burn some (but not the best) before their face, lest in case of sickness or other evil, they should think that the gods still in existence inflicted it. The remainder send to Raiatea as a rejoicing to us, and we will send them to England as a rejoicing to them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When the <em>Endeavour</em> arrived at Aitutaki on 9 July 1823, canoes approached demonstrating their peaceful intentions by holding up spelling books and European-style hats. Coming ashore, Williams found the <em>maraes</em> had been destroyed and a large plastered chapel (200 ft long) built, together with a five bedroom house for Papeiha and Vahapata.</p>\n<p>Encountering a pair of ‘grim-looking gods’ being used as pillars to support a cooking house, he offered a pair of fish-hooks in exchange. Their owner, according to Williams ‘propped up the house, took out the idols, and threw them down; and while they were prostrate on the ground, he gave them a kick, saying, “There – your reign is at an end”.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Williams delivered a sermon in the chapel, Papeiha and Vahapata before the pulpit, dressed in European clothes and facing the congregation. Afterwards, according to Williams, The gods and bundles of gods, which had escaped destruction, thirty-one in number, were carried in triumph to the ship’s boat; and we came off to the vessel with the trophies of our bloodless conquest’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sailing in search of Rarotonga, Papeiha updated Williams on events at Aitutaki over the previous eighteen months, including three periods of armed conflict (suggesting Christian conquest was not as bloodless as claimed). Papeiha and Vahapata had initially been regarded as ‘Two logs of drift-wood, washed on shore by the waves of the ocean’, but their status was enhanced by the arrival of the <em>Endeavour</em> on her way to New South Wales in December 1822, bringing spelling books, axes, pigs and goats from Ra’iatea.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Soon afterwards, Papeiha called for the destruction of the island’s <em>maraes</em>, the presentation of ‘idols’ to him, and the construction of a chapel. Gleaming white, with plaster made from roasted coral, the new chapel must have dazzled those who had never before seen such a building.</p>\n<p>After a week of searching unsuccessfully for Rarotonga, the <em>Endeavour</em> steered for the island of Mangaia. Swimming ashore, Papeiha explained the nature of the ship and its mission. On landing, however, the teachers and their property were seized – a saw broken into three, bonnets dragged through the water, bedsteads seized, and cocoa-nut oil poured over people’s bodies. The teachers’ wives were carried into the woods, only to be rescued when the ship fired a small cannon.</p>\n<p>Papeiha, who had been strangled during the attack with a tiputa (a poncho type upper garment of bark cloth, worn by many converts), told the leader who had encouraged them to land what he thought of this behaviour. The man in question, we are told, wept, declaring that all heads were an equal height on his island.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Months later, the <em>Endeavour</em> returned to Mangaia on its way to New South Wales with Tyerman and Bennet, leaving Davida and Tiere, both unmarried men from Taha’a, as missionaries on the island, which had suffered a severe epidemic following this earlier visit.</p>\n<p>After Mangaia, the <em>Endeavour</em> went to Atiu, where John Orsmond had sent a pair of missionaries from Bora Bora a few months previously. They hadn’t made much progress, but when Rongo-ma-Tane, a leader on the island, visited the ship he was told about events at Aitutaki and shown the once powerful ‘idols’ lying in the hold. Attending a service on deck, he determined to bring about the same changes on his island, asking to purchase an axe with which he could cut posts to build ‘God’s house’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Persuading Rongo-ma-Tane to stay on board, they sailed to Mitiaro and Mauke, where teachers were landed and instructions given for <em>maraes</em> and ‘evil spirits’ to be destroyed. Williams could not help but see the hand of God in the immediate conversion of these islands. Rongo-ma-tane then directed the <em>Endeavour</em> towards Rarotonga, returning to Atiu with his requested axes, and ‘other useful articles’.</p>\n<p>After struggling with contrary winds for several days, the <em>Endeavour</em> was about to return to Ra’iatea when land was sighted from the top of the mast. Papeiha, Vahineino and one of the Rarotongans from Aitutaki went ashore, where it was agreed that teachers should land. Makea, who Williams described as ‘the King’ – ‘about six feet high, and very stout; of noble appearance, and of a truly commanding aspect’ – came aboard the ship. Among the four Rarotonga women and two men who were returning from Aitutaki, he met Tapairu, a close relative.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Two teachers and their wives spent the night ashore with Papeiha, but returned to the ship early the next morning. Williams was told that a rival chief (possibly Pa Te Pou, <em>ariki</em> of Takitumu) had tried to take one of the female teachers as his wife, but that Tapairu defended the women. Williams was reluctant to abandon the intended teachers to their fate, but Papeiha volunteered to remain at Rarotonga alone if his friend Tiberio was sent to join him. Papeiha waved goodbye to Williams, going ashore in a canoe with just the clothes on his back, his Bible and some spelling books.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Arriving back at Ra’iatea, ‘as other warriors feel a pride in displaying trophies of the victories they win’, Williams triumphantly hung his ‘prisoners’, ‘the rejected idols of Aitutaki’ from the yard-arms of the <em>Endeavour</em> as they entered the harbour in triumph.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Once again, the coconut oil chandeliers were lit, and the ‘idols were suspended about the chapel’. Twenty-five were then sent to Tyerman and Bennet, then still at Tahiti and six others directly to the Missionary Museum in England.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams made another trip in the <em>Endeavour,</em> to Rurutu and Rimatara, but this would be his last. Traders at Sydney had persuaded the Governor of New South Wales to apply a duty to sugar cane and tobacco imports, rendering the ship an unprofitable and unsustainable enterprise. In addition, the Directors in London disapproved of Williams involving himself in financial speculation, so the <em>Endeavour</em> was sent to Sydney to be sold. Williams provided the Directors’ with his interpretation of events:</p>\n<p>Satan knows well that this ship was the most fatal weapon ever formed against his interests in the great South Sea; and, therefore, as soon as he felt the effects of its first blow, he has wrested it out of our hands.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Appealing for funds for a replacement, Williams and Threlkeld wrote:</p>\n<p>Think not of the expense of such a vessel. Remember the gods are to be her cargo, and your reward. Twice has the Lord God sent you these from hence and from other islands, and your eyes shall see yet greater things.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Williams returned to Rarotonga in May 1827, it had been less than four years since his first visit. When Tyerman and Bennet, together with Threlkeld, visited the island on their way to to New South Wales in late 1824 they reported that the whole population were already engaged in building a six hundred foot long chapel.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> How had Papeiha reorganised the island along Christian principles in such a short period?</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Sissons, who has closely examined the establishment of Christianity in Rarotonga, as part of the wider contemporary phenomenon he calls <em>The Polynesian Iconoclasm,</em> has suggested that apparent conversion was ‘as much a material process of indigenisation as it was a local appropriation of foreign ideas’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> What does he mean? His reconstruction of events is approximately as follows.</p>\n<p>Rarotonga was, and remains, organised into three main districts (<em>vaka,</em> literally canoes, perhaps referencing the arrival of ancestors generations previously): Te Au o Tonga, Puaikura and Takitumu, each overseen by an <em>ariki</em> (high chief or ‘king’). In the decade before Papeiha’s arrival, conflict between the three <em>vaka</em> resulted in the dominance of the Takitumu district. In late July 1823, however, Papeiha arrived at Avarua in the Te Au o Tonga district where Makea was <em>ariki</em>.</p>\n<p>By November, Papeiha had assembled a group of high status students, much like the early students at Papetoai, including Makea’s eldest son. After Tiberio arrived in December, the two evangelists toured the island, meeting the leaders of the other districts. When they returned to Avarua, a priest brought his son to be taught, offering to destroy a wooden ‘idol’ in return. Papeiha unwrapped and cut up the image before burning it, roasting and eating bananas in the embers. Within ten days fourteen further ‘idols’ had been destroyed, or at least dethroned. Soon afterwards Tinomana, <em>ariki of</em> Arorangi in Puaikura district, the other defeated region, sanctioned the destruction of his <em>marae.</em></p>\n<p>In March 1824, Pa Te Pou, <em>ariki</em> in the dominant Takitumu region, summoned Papeiha and Tiberio to Ngatangiia to also burn his ‘idols’. Soon afterwards, a feast was held at Avarua in Makea’s district which included a prayer meeting at which <em>ariki</em> and regional chiefs, <em>mata’iapo,</em> wore hats made from bark cloth taken from destroyed ‘idols’. It seems that the three <em>ariki</em> united to form a single large settlement at Avarua, providing feasts that accompanied the construction the large chapel, visited by Tyerman and Bennet in June 1824. The people of the dominant Takitumu district worked on one side of the building, while those of the defeated Te Au O Tonga and Puaikura districts worked on the other. According to John Williams, who visited the chapel:</p>\n<p>This, from the circumstances of its erection, was rather an interesting building, but it was destitute of elegance; for, although plastered and floored, and looking exceedingly well at a distance, the workmanship was rough, and the doors were formed of planks lashed together with cnet, which also supplied the place of hinges. One of its most striking peculiarities was the presence of many indelicate heathen figures carved on the centre posts. This was accounted for from the circumstances, that, when built, a considerable part of the people were heathens; and as a portion of the work was allotted to each district unaccompanied by specific directions as to the precise manner of its performance, the builders thought that the figure with which they decorated their maraes would be equally ornamental in the main pillars of a Christian sanctuary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Robert Bourne visited in October 1825 the chapel had recently been plastered, and he was shown ’the cumbrous deities, fourteen in number… now lying like Dagon of old before the ark’. Dagon was an ancient Syrian God, and according to 1 Samuel 5 in the Old Testament, after the Philistines placed the captured ark of the covenant in Dagon’s temple, they returned the next morning the found Dagon fallen face downwards on the group. When Dagon was raised up, he was found the next day fallen again, with both his head and two hands cut off on the threshold of the temple.</p>\n<p>Despite such Old Testament precedent, Bourne recognised that a third of Rarotonga’s population still did not support this religious transformation, having pledged allegiance to district chiefs and priests in opposition to the three <em>ariki.</em> Papeiha and Tiberio (armed with a gun) even led an attack on one of the rebel settlements, capturing further ancestral poles by force.</p>\n<p>When the population of Avarua decamped to Ngatangiia, following the arrival of Williams and Pitman in May 1827, it was to begin the construction of another chapel in that region. The chapel’s rafters were wrapped in bark cloth taken from the <em>ki’iki’i</em> which had been torn apart, and some of the ancestral poles were themselves hung from its rafters. After this had been completed, a replacement chapel was built at Avarua (1828) and a third at Arorangi (1830). In a statement of unity, the three chapels were linked by a new coastal road, the <em>ara Tapu</em> (sacred path), which replaced the <em>ara metua</em> (ancient path) which had connected the district <em>marae</em>, along which annual processions were typically made.</p>\n<p>Just as at Tahiti and Ra’iatea, the adoption of Christianity at Rarotonga was associated with a consolidation and centralisation of chiefly power, materialised in the construction of new churches. These powerfully demonstrated the capacity of <em>ariki</em> to demand and coordinate the labour and resources of others. Resistance continued at Rarotonga, however, and in mid-1828 the church in the Takitumu district was burned down by rebels. Others attempted to burn the church and school-houses at Avarua, defiling the seats of the chiefs and missionaries in the chapel, as well as the pulpit. Only after an epidemic in mid-1830 did violence end. Even in 1831, Charles Pitman could write in his journal that:</p>\n<p>The desire of nearly all the people of the island is for their old practices being revived… should the Chiefs again turn their backs to the Teachers the people would for the greater part by far return with them with joy to their heathenish practices.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This chapter began with the image on the title page of John Williams’ book, showing the presentation and destruction of ‘idols’ in front of of the teachers’ houses at Ngatangiia. It ends by considering this image as readers would have encounetred it in early editions of the book, alongside a colour image produced by George Baxter with the title ‘<em>Te Po, a Chief of Rarotonga’</em> (Te Pou Ariki of Takitumu)<em>.</em></p>\n<p>The image is magnificent, showing  the <em>ariki</em> with his spear aloft, holding a fan in the other hand. His noble body is wrapped with tattoos and gleaming white barkcloth, his head adorned by a headdress suggestive of a crown. His centrality within the image seems to demonstrate mastery over both land and sea. In the background, however, a lightly sketched European ship (not evident in the painting, above, on which this seems to have been based) is suggestive of new arrivals.</p>\n<p>Viewed in combination with the image on the title page, which would have faced it when opening the book, the images present a contrast. They are images of before and after, suggestive of conversion, evoking images of imaginary tattooed British ancestors before the coming of Christianity. While the conversion of Rarotonga involved transformations in dress, as well as the replacement of one type of religious structure, the <em>marae</em> with another, the <em>chapel,</em> these outward changes likely mask many continuities in the attitudes of the majority of the population.</p>\n<p>One undeniable change, however, seems to have been the destruction and removal of wood carvings that evoked ancestral power. The ‘gigantic idol’ at the Missionary Museum (now in the British Museum) appears to have been the only <em>ki’iki’i</em> of its size to survive. In 1853, Isaia Papehia, the fifteen year old son of Papeiha, whose maternal grandfather was <em>ariki</em> of Tinomana, travelled to London with the Rev. William Gill, who had been a missionary on Rarotonga since 1839.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Visiting the Missionary Museum in London, Isaia encountered the ‘idol of his own grandfather of which he had heard much; the sight of it affected him to tears, and he expressed deep compassion for the people of his native land’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>According to Rev. Gordon, who returned to Polynesia with him in 1856 in the missionary ship <em>John Williams</em> (Chapter 15), Isaia told the missionary meetings he attended at Sydney and Melbourne that:</p>\n<p>He is a great big fellow and when I saw him I was greatly astonished and climbed up and broke off a piece of his nose to take to Rarotonga, and I asked Dr Tidman [Secretary of the LMS] to let me take him back to Rarotonga, to show the young people the queer thing their fathers worshipped, but he say, ’No let you do that.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>I have been incredibly lucky to have worked closely over the years with a number of colleagues with Pacific specialisms over the years, from whom I have learned an enormous amount: Steven Hooper, Karen Jacobs, Nicholas Thomas, Julie Adams, Maia Nuku and Alice Christophe, among others. Nevertheless, as an interloper in the region, any errors or faults are entirely my own.</p>\n<p>Recently, I have been grateful for encouragement from Rod Dixon, Jean Mason and Jeffrey Sissons in setting up a collaborative PhD project with the British Museum to further unpack this extraordinary process of conversion and collection through the surviving collections. I am looking forward to their feedback on this chaper, as well as that of Mililani Ganivet, who we appointed to the studentship in 2023.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div><section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Williams, J.

These would, he proposed, be useful ‘in conveying a more lively impression of the actual degradation of the heathen and the polluting character of idol worship; and also of shewing what Missionaries had been able to effect in promoting the knowledge of the True God and the Only Saviour’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis referred Leipoldt to the list at the end of his letter, itemising ‘the accompanying specimens’, as well as books ‘prepared by our Missionaries in different parts of the World’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>With items from the Pacific, South Asia, China and southern Africa, the list covers the main areas in which the LMS had been most active over the previous thirty-five years. Half the ‘specimens’ appear to have been religious ‘idols’, from Tahiti, the Cook Islands, Myanmar, India and possibly China, with a similar number of seemingly everyday items from Africa – a ladle, a knife, a necklace and two rings.</p>\n<p>While not obviously demonstrating ‘the degradation of the heathen’, these would have been of considerable interest in Barmen, since the Rhenish Missionary Society sent its first four recruits to South Africa under the guidance of John Philip, the Scottish superintendent of LMS missions there. Philip had travelled to London in 1826 to lobby for the rights of indigenous people at the Cape (more on this below), returning to South Africa in 1829 with recruits from the LMS, the Rhenish Missionary Society, as well as the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society (a Protestant organisation established in 1822).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>There follows a listing of religious and missionary translations, tracts and other texts – grammars, spelling books and memoirs. The way their descriptions are laid out, however, asserts a categorical distinction between printed texts and the ‘specimens’ listed separately above, including a catechism from Madras, handwritten on leaves.</p>\n<p>The numbering of these twinned lists suggests that twelve printed books were sent to Barmen but only eleven ‘specimens’, including the palm leaf catechism. At the bottom of the page, however, a single line adds ‘All wrapped up in a Piece of Tahitian Cloth’, suggesting there were equal numbers of printed books and other artefacts, if we count the Tahitian cloth as a ‘specimen’ in its own right.</p>\n<p>Why Ellis chose to wrap the other items in Tahitian barkcloth is unclear, but he certainly knew that tapa was used for wrapping valuable items in Polynesia, such as the recently arrived ancestral pole from Rarotonga (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>).</p>\n<p>In <em>Polynesian Researches,</em> published three years earlier, Ellis noted that images of gods were generally ‘clothed’ with native cloth, but also that that when he gave copies of the newly printed Gospel of Luke to five men from Tahiti, ‘each wrapped his book up in a piece of white native cloth’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Barkcloth was used to wrap the bodies of the deceased, but was increasingly also used to cover the bodies of living Christian converts, especially women. Can we regard Ellis’ decision to wrap these items in Tahitian cloth as an indicator of their value, or does it simply indicate the ready availability of such cloth at his office in London?</p>\n<p>The letter from Ellis to Leipoldt, together with the artefacts which accompanied it, illustrates not only the existence of cooperative relationships between Protestant missionary societies in different parts of northern Europe (the LMS had also worked closely with the Netherlands Missionary Society since the late 18<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> century, as well as sending a number of earlier Berlin-trained German-speaking missionaries to South Africa – <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a>), but importantly also the way in which the circulation and display of artefacts contributed to these.</p>\n<p>While the division of this list, between handmade ‘specimens’ and printed ‘books’, is suggestive of Webb Keane’s semiotic ideologies and the Protestant prioritisation of printed vernacular texts,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> I’d like to suggest that the inclusion of equal numbers of ‘specimens’, ‘all wrapped up in a piece of Tahitian cloth’, tells us something important about the development of what I would like to call the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex.</p>\n<p>The Exhibitionary Complex is a phrase originally coined by Tony Bennett in a well-known journal paper, published in Spring 1988.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Grappling with the implications of Michel Foucault’s work on the reforming institutions of the ‘carcerial archipelago’: the prison, the asylum, and the clinic. Bennet took up Foucault’s archaeological and genealogical projects in relation to <em>the Birth of the Museum</em>, suggesting that public museums should be considered in relation to other forms of display, such as international expositions, arcades and department stores, as well as other contemporary technologies of vision.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Bennett ultimately argued that museums were institutions, ‘not of confinement but of exhibition, forming a complex of disciplinary and power relations whose development might more fruitfully be juxtaposed to, rather than aligned with, the formation of Foucault’s ‘carcerial archipelago’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He suggested that reforming institutions of incarceration saw the bodies of the condemned, previously a focus for very public periodic displays of power on the scaffold, increasingly subjected to surveillance and regulation. By contrast, he argued the ‘exhibitionary complex’ transferred objects and bodies:</p>\n<p>from the enclosed and private domains in which they had previously been displayed (but to a restricted public) into progressively more open and public arenas where, through the representations to which they were subjected, they formed vehicles for inscribing and broadcasting the messages of power (but of a different type) throughout society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In pushing back against the idea that museums could be considered institutions of confinement, Bennet suggested:</p>\n<p>It seems to imply that works of art had previously wandered through the streets of Europe like the Ships of Fools in Foucault’s <em>Madness and Civilisation;</em> or that geological and natural history specimens had been displayed before the world, like the condemned on the scaffold, rather than being withheld from public gaze, secreted in the <em>studiolo</em> of princes, or made accessible only to the limited gaze of high society in the <em>cabinets des curious</em> of the aristocracy.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The terms of Bennet’s objection to considering museums as part of a ‘carcerial archipelago’ are significant – his focus on ‘the streets of Europe’ and the ‘<em>studiolo</em> of princes’ locates the Exhibitionary Complex in relation to an almost exclusively European genealogy. Arguably it also positions this in Europe’s South, seemingly insulated from the most significant impacts of the Protestant reformation.</p>\n<p>However, works of art had once moved through the streets of Europe, as part of spectacular processions of religious images (they still do in parts of southern Europe), but during the reformation and counter-reformation were increasingly confined within institutions (when they survived iconoclastic purges). We can arguably hear the echoes of these earlier image wars in recent calls to remove the statues of slave-owners and colonialists from our streets, in order to confine them safely within our museums.</p>\n<p>This suggests we might consider the development of the Exhibitionary Complex beyond the immediate frame provided by the French Revolution of 1789, and the conversion of the Louvre into a museum of confiscated royal and church paintings in 1793. Indeed, it seems important in setting the scene for Foucault’s ‘modern episteme’ to account for the revolutionary dimensions of Britain’s seventeenth century, as well as the Protestant substrate which operated in France long after the revocation of Edict of Nantes in 1685.</p>\n<p>Foucault suggested that what he called governmentality, the practices of power deployed by the modern state, were ultimately rooted in the individualising pastoral practices of the Christian Church.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Commenting on Weber’s linking of the Protestant ethic to the spirit of capitalism, the Dutch Philosopher Antoon Braeckman has recently argued that ‘the Protestant form of life has also proved to be the soil in which the governmental power of the modern state first took root.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, he suggested that the process by which:</p>\n<p>many governmental initiatives that had arisen in the Protestant church communities were transferred to secular governments… provides a potentially fruitful path for further shaping Foucault’s unfinished genealogy of the modern state.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Can we regard the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex as an ‘unwritten chapter’ or ‘missing link’ in Foucault’s Genealogy of the Modern State, allowing us to chart a series of peculiarly Protestant developments in governmentality?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Can it be regarded as part of the complex of pastoral techniques which “have nestled, multiplied, and spread with the laicised framework of the state apparatus”, according to Foucault?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Bennet suggested that the Exhibitionary Complex was ‘a set of cultural technologies concerned to organise a voluntarily self-regulating citizenry’, as part of the ‘the ethical and educative function of the modern state’, ultimately feeding into the ‘development of the bourgeois democratic polity’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By necessity not simply a European project, the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex provides an alternative vantage point from which to consider a range of globally-connected practices of confinement and display.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I intend to suggest that the dual dimensions of confinement and display form part of most carcerial institutions. While their precise configuration shifts in the movement from the scaffold to the prison, or the religious carnival to the art gallery (in part by moving indoors and becoming more permanent – a process of enclosure), power nevertheless continues to operate in spectacular ways.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Nineteenth century prisons, hospitals and asylums often formed highly visible architectural statements within urban spaces, and many maintained public visiting hours no more or less restrictive than those of most nineteenth century museums. This suggests the ‘carcerial archipelago’ and the ‘exhibitionary complex’ are far more aligned than Bennet suggested.</p>\n<p>Foucault’s clearest statement in relation to museums seems to come in an essay, <em>Of Other Spaces,</em> originally published in October 1984, shortly after he died. It begins:</p>\n<p>The great obsession of the nineteenth century was, as we know, history: with its themes of development and of suspension, of crisis and cycle, themes of the ever-accumulating past, with its great preponderence of dead men and the menacing glaciation of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This he contrasted with a twentieth century focus on space, characterised as the ‘epoch of simultaneity’, suggesting that many contemporary polemics ‘oppose the pious descendants of time and the determined inhabitants of space’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The focus for Foucault’s piece of fairly oracular writing, however, is the socially constituted other places that he calls heterotopias, defined as ‘counter-sites, a kind of effectively enacted utopia in which the real sites, all the other real sites that can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> These had their origins, he suggests, in ‘crisis heterotopias’, temporarily constituted sacred or privileged places, the liminal zones constituted by what Arnold Van Gennep called <em>Rites de Passage.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Foucault suggests these were gradually replaced by what he calls ‘heterotopias of deviation’, the institutions of his carcerial archipelago. He explores the ways in which existing heterotopias have been repurposed, using the example of the cemetery, which until the end of the eighteenth century was often situated at the heart of European cities. From the nineteenth century, however, these were increasingly relocated to their edges, where, according to Foucault ‘everyone has a right to her or his own little box for her or his own little personal decay’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The museum, like the library, according to Foucault, is a heterotopia ‘in which time never stops building up and topping its own summit’:</p>\n<p>… the idea of accumulating everything, or establishing a sort of general archive, the will to enclose in one place all times, all epochs, all forms, all tastes, the idea of constituting a place of all times that is itself outside of time and inaccessible to its ravages, the project of organising in this way a sort of perpetual and indefinite accumulation of time in an immobile place, this whole idea belongs to our modernity. The museum and the library are heterotopias that are proper to the western culture of the nineteenth century.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>If we consider the <em>Ti’i,</em> described as an ‘Idol from Tahiti’ at the beginning of Ellis’ list, we can imagine its passage between a series of heterotopias, at which confinement was enacted as well as display.</p>\n<p>It likely came from a <em>marae,</em> a ceremonial enclosure in Tahiti where, according to Ellis, <em>Ti’i</em> generally represented the spirits of departed ancestors ‘supposed to be exceedingly irritable and cruel’. They were confined to a house ten or twelve feet off the ground ’to keep them out of the way of men, as it was imagined they were constantly strangling, otherwise destroying the chiefs and people’. They had custodians:</p>\n<p>appointed constantly to attend them, and to keep them wrapped in the choicest kinds of cloth, to take them out whenever there was a pae atua, or general exhibition of the gods; to anoint them frequently with fragrant oil; and to sleep in the house with them at night. All this was done, to keep them pacified.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This suggests that the marae was itself a heterotopia at which both confinement and display were deployed as technologies in order to attempt to gain a degree of control over potentially dangerous and disruptive spirits.</p>\n<p>The <em>Ti’i</em> must have escaped the spectacular iconoclastic displays at which similar items were publicly burned in the years after 1815 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>), becoming a ‘prisoner’ of the missionaries – to use the term adopted by both John Williams and Lancelot Threlkeld (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>). It may have been displayed from chapel pulpits in Polynesia, in New South Wales, as well across the British Isles.</p>\n<p>The principal idol of Pomare’s family was conveyed around the Independent Chapel in Falmouth, Cornwall, during a Missionary Festival in August 1819 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>). The following year, ‘the abandoned idols which had lately been imported from the islands of the South Seas were exhibited on a platform in front of the pulpit’ during a Missionary meeting at the newly built Carr’s Lane chapel in Birmingham.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Missionary Museum, established in London in 1815,  provided a seemingly permanent place of custody for the majority of ‘idols’ sent from the Pacific, where they could be displayed to visitors, especially when supporters from around the country came to London for the annual ‘missionary week’ meetings in May. The availability of these artefacts at the Missionary Museum allowed them to become the sources for the production of imagery, achieving even wider circulation through missionary publications, books as well as periodicals.</p>\n<p>The Missionary Museum seems to have been a location from which these items continued to circulate for display at missionary meetings elsewhere. It was a central institutional node within a much larger complex, constituted by a shifting network of missionaries and supporters, coordinating the circulation of artefacts between a range of heterotopias. In this, it mirrored the adjacent LMS administrative offices, which oversaw the circulation of funds and information between Mission stations and supporting churches.</p>\n<p>The Missionary Museum confined but also displayed a artefacts originally made for display, as what Victor Turner called ‘objects of reflection’, during particular ceremonies, but these were increasingly redeployed as part of what Carol Duncan memorably called <em>Civilizing Rituals.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The despatch of specimens from the Missionary Museum in London to the new training institution at Barmen, part of Rhenish Prussia since the Congress of Vienna in 1815, extended the range of the developing Missionary Exhibitionary Complex, seeding a collection that grew into a substantial Missionary Museum that continues to operate in the twenty-first century. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Similar items were given to missionary institutions in other parts of the world – Tyerman and Bennet presented Polynesian ‘idols’ to the collection of the Baptist Missionary William Carey at Serampore College during their global journey of inspection, which, like the Anglo-Chinese College established at Malacca in 1818 <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/dr-morrisons-chinese-and-english-dictionary/\" target=\"_blank\">(Chapter 9)</a>, maintained its own museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>But the missionary exhibitionary complex was not confined to spaces of display with official missionary associations. As early as May 1799, Captain Wilson of the Duff presented items to the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society, established just six years earlier (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-cession-of-matavai/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 1</a>).</p>\n<p>There seems to have been considerable overlap between misionary supporters and the membership of such societies – the fruits of Britain’s burgeoning ‘civic culture’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In December 1821, John Campbell presented African items to the Royal Dublin Society following his second journey to South Africa.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In addition, George Bennet presented further material to the collections of Literary and Philosophical Societies in Leeds, Sheffield and Saffron Walden.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>William Ellis’ letter, suggesting the items he sent to Barmen would convey ‘a more lively impression’ suggests that they needed to be seen to be believed. The fact that they could be displayed at all, however, reinforced the second part of his statement, ‘shewing what Missionaries had been able to effect’. Such exhibitions allowed the re-formation of society by missionaries to be presented as not only necessary, but possible.</p>\n<p>Tony Bennet positioned the Great Exhibition of 1851, alongside the opening of the new prisons at Mettray in 1840 and Pentonville in 1842, as examples of institutions that brought together disciplines and techniques in ways that guided future institutions. In the case of the Great Exhibition, he suggested these emerged from ‘the previous histories of museums, panoramas, Mechanics’ Institute exhibitions, art galleries and arcades’, and were translated ‘into exhibitionary forms which, in simultaneously ordering objects for public inspection and ordering the public that was inspected’ had a profound and lasting influence on the subsequent development of museums, art galleries, expositions, and department stores’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Martin J. Wiener, by contrast, positioned the 1851 Great Exhibition as ‘an end and not a beginning’ that ‘would see the high-water mark of educated opinion’s enthusiasm for industrial capitalism’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By 1832 we can already find many of the essential techniques deployed at the Great Exhibition operating within the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex. This suggests that we should treat missionary display practices as a significant ancestor within the genealogy of public museums.</p>\n<p>One might counter that the British Museum had been open to the public since 1759, asserting an essentially Enlightenment genealogy for the public museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> I have pointed out elsewhere that the British Museum was significantly transformed during the second half of the nineteenth century, and between 1823 to 1846 was effectively a building site.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> A visitor to the British Museum’s ‘Ethnographical room’, a single room displaying British antiquities alongside ‘clubs from the South Seas and trifling objects from China and elsewhere’, after it reopened in 1848 declared:</p>\n<p>Never was such a disgraceful jumble of things seen, even in a local museum supported by voluntary contributions and regulated by a batch of half- educated provincial antiquaries . . . All our early collectors, Tradescant, and Ashmole, and Thoresby aimed at something like arrangement; but here, in the nineteenth century and in a national museum, we have a collection confounding all the unities of time and place and only worthy of a retired dealer in marine stores. And yet, this is one of the first rooms a foreigner is obliged to see on entering the British Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Following its reoperning, on the eve of the 1851 Great Exhibition, the British Museum remained a long way from leading the development of display techniques that came to define the Exhibitionary Complex as it developed during the second half of the nineteenth century, particularly in relation to what became known as ‘ethnographic collections’, from other parts of the world.</p>\n<p>Tony Bennet is of course right that ‘the Exhibitionary Complex’ contributed in no small part to the formation of particular kinds of political ‘subjects’, but it did this, at least partly, through the confinement and display of certain kinds of material ‘objects’.</p>\n<p>‘Subject’ and the ‘object’ can fruitfully be regarded as mutually constituting categories, products of what Bruno Latour called the ‘work of purification’ <em>–</em> categorisation and classification being an essential part of the institutional work of museums – life beyond their walls, by contrast, involves an endless proliferation of hybrids.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>1832 is a key moment from which to consider the relationship between heterotopias and society because of significant transformations in the nature of political subjecthood in Britain (paralleled in many ways by the July Revolution in France, of 1830).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> According to E.P. Thompson:</p>\n<p>In the years between 1780 and 1832 most English working people came to feel an identity of interests as between themselves, and against their rulers and employers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Contemporary observers seem to have been acutely aware of this profound sense of transition – George Eliot famously set her novel <em>Middlemarch</em> between 1829 and 1832, exploring the political reform movement alongside Dr Tertius Lydgate’s attempts to reform a country hospital, with a backdrop provided by the coming of the railways.</p>\n<p>The young John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), a contemporary of Eliot’s fictional Will Ladislaw,  declared in a series of essays on <em>The Spirit of the Age,</em> published in 1831 :</p>\n<p>The conviction is already not far from being universal, that the times are pregnant with change; and that the nineteenth century will be known to posterity as the era of one of the greatest revolutions of which history has preserved the remembrance, in the human mind, and in the whole constitution of human society. Even the religious world teems with new interpretations of the Prophecies, foreboding mighty changes near at hand. It is felt that men are henceforth to be held together by new ties, and separated by new barriers; for the ancient bonds will no longer unite, nor the ancient boundaries confine.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By 1832, William Ellis, approaching the age of 40, understood the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex better than anyone else. As a young gardener, he had been inspired to become a missionary by letters sent by John Campbell from South Africa (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a>), and would have seen many of the items collected on that journey at the Missionary museum in London after it opened in April 1815. In October 1816, on his way to the Pacific, Ellis encountered ‘the Idols Gods of Tahiti’, sent by Pomare II, at the Parramatta home of Samuel Marsden, on their way to London (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>).</p>\n<p>After overseeing the printing of the Tahitian spelling book at Mo’orea in 1817, Ellis relocated to Huahine to establish his mission there. Five years later he visited Hawai’i, returning there between February 1823 and September 1824 to assist the work of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. During the first half of 1825, Ellis spent five months speaking to American congregations from a base at Boston, returning to Britain where he worked on the publication of his <em>Narrative of a Tour through Hawaii,</em> published in early 1826 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/principal-kinds-of-native-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 7</a>).</p>\n<p>Three years later, Ellis published <em>Polynesian Researches</em>, including the detailed descriptions of a range of Polynesian practices cited above, as well as depictions of artefacts at the LMS museum, including a plate depicting ‘idols’ which formed the frontispiece to Volume 2, shown above. Alongside preparing his books for publication, Ellis spent much of the five years following his return travelling around the British Isles promoting the work of the London Missionary Society.</p>\n<p>An illustrative episode took place on 23 May 1829 when Ellis and a number of other LMS representatives arrived at Enniskerry, a village outside Dublin. They were greeted by the evangelical rector, Robert Daly, who declared that although it was supposed to be the quarterly meeting of (Anglican) Church Missionary Society (CMS), the day’s collection would be given to the LMS. Having spoken about the work of the society’s work in Africa, China and the South Seas to around 250 people, Ellis was presented with £13 collected from those present.</p>\n<p>He was then invited to tea at Powerscourt House by the widowed “good Lady Powerscourt” (Theodosia Anne Wingfield, née Howard), who subsequently sponsored and hosted several conferences on biblical prophecy between 1831 and 1833 (possibly those alluded to by Mill). These were attended by John Nelson Darby and Edward Irving, whose views on the coming end of the world led to the establishment of the Plymouth Brethren.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Over tea, Ellis met Elizabeth Tighe, wife of the evangelical hymn writer and a contributor to the Evangelical Magazine, Thomas Kelly, together with their daughters (one of whom was my Gt. Gt. Gt. Grandmother).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was only in 1831 that Ellis adopted a less itinerant lifestyle, first as Assistant and then as Foreign Secretary of the London Missionary Society, when he also seems to have become responsible for the society’s museum and its collection.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In the same year, John Stuart Mill suggested that one could ‘learn in a morning’s walk through London more of the history of England during the nineteenth century, than all the professed English histories in existence will tell him concerning the other eighteen’ and Ellis had, in the course of his missionary journeys, seemingly been everywhere and met everyone.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis must have recognised, like Mill, that ‘the old order of things has become unsuited to the state of society and of the human mind’. Mill suggested Britain was in the process of proclaiming ‘almost with one voice’ that the old institutions ‘are vicious both in the outline and in the details, and they <em>shall</em> be renovated, and purified, and made fit for civilised man’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> At least part of what he was referring to was the campaign for political reform, culminating in Britain’s Representation of the People Act of 1832, known as the Great Reform Act.</p>\n<p>This saw the removal of pocket and rotten boroughs, controlled by corporate interests, and the granting of parliamentary seats to industrial cities such as Birmingham, Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield, which had all grown significantly over the previous three decades. Also newly represented was Manchester, a centre for the industrial manufacture of cotton cloth, where the Peterloo Massacre saw many lives lost at a demonstration demanding parliamentary representation in 1819.</p>\n<p>When Sir Robert Peel, son of a wealthy Lancashire textile manufacturer, became Home Secretary in 1822, he began the development of Britain’s professional police force, intended to govern by consent and regulation, rather than the brutal impositions of state military power, as at Peterloo. The Peterloo massacre also led to the establishment in 1821 of The Manchester Guardian (continuing as The Guardian), founded to:</p>\n<p>Zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious liberty… warmly advocate the cause of Reform… endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy… and support… whatever measures may… tend to promote the moral advantage, or the political welfare, of the Community.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The 1832 extension of the franchise was significant, in part because it demonstrated that constitutional reform was possible, though what it enacted remained a long way from what we might now regard as universal suffrage. It has been estimated that the effect of the bill was to extend the voting franchise in England from around 1 per cent of the population to around 7 per cent, in effect providing a stake in the constitution for the rapidly expanding middle classes.</p>\n<p>In doing so it opened the way for demands for working class representation which played out in the Chartist Movement as the century went on. Further extensions of the franchise followed in 1867 and 1884, also important dates in the history of public museums, suggesting that at least part of the function of the Exhibitionary Complex was to educate, or possibly ‘civilize’ newly enfranchised voters.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It might be tempting to regard this as an insular British political history, with few wider implications, but it sheds important light on the establishment of the Tahitian Legislative Assembly, overseen by London Missionary Society representatives in 1824. This gave ordinary Tahitians political representation eight years before similar rights were granted in Britain (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/10-two-of-the-tur-rursna/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 10</a>).</p>\n<p>It is also illuminating to consider John Philip’s campaign for the Cape’s indigenous people, pursued when he returned to London in 1826. Before repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts in 1828 made it possible for Dissenters to hold public office in Britain (similar Emancipation for Catholics followed in 1829, prompting some of the eschatological anxieties of succeeding years), Philip persuaded Thomas Fowell Buxton (leader of Britain’s parliamentary anti-slavery lobby after William Wilberforce retired in 1825) that racial restrictions on the Cape’s indigenous people amounted to slavery by another name.</p>\n<p>Philip’s 1828 book <em>Researches in South Africa</em> assembled a range of evidence in support of his case, but its preface frames his argument in relation to a universalist conception of natural rights, rooted in a particular understanding of divine creation as well as the British constitution:</p>\n<p>Independent of printed statutes, there are certain rights which human beings possess, and of which they cannot be deprived but by manifest injustice. The wanderer in the desert has a right to his life, to his liberty, his wife, his children and his property. The Hottentot has a right to a fair price for his labour; to an exemption from cruelty and oppression; to choose the place of his abode, and to enjoy the society of his children; and no one can deprive him of those rights without violating the laws of nature and of nations… The Hottentots, in addition to the unalienable rights conferred upon them by their Creator, have prescriptive rights in their favour; they are regarded by the British government as a free people; and the colonial law says, that they are to be treated in their persons, in their properties and in their possessions, the same as other free people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When asked by William Huskisson, Secretary of State at the Colonial Office, a man who in 1830 became the first railway fatality in history, to describe what he wanted in one sentence, Philip replied:</p>\n<p>I require nothing for the Hottentots, but the power of bringing their labour to a fair market.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>[^If Napoleon really did call the English “a nation of shopkeepers”, then central to their commercial self-conception was a right to freely exchange their labour for payment – an individual right increasingly asserted by the British Middle and Working classes both for themselves as well as for others.]</p>\n<p>The extension of the franchise in 1832 represented a concession to what Martin Wiener called ‘the English Industrial Spirit’, rooted in the urban areas where evangelical and dissenting churches made up the bulk of supporters of the London Missionary Society. But this local political concession also had significant global consequences. It was the overwhelmingly Whig parliament, elected in 1833, which voted for the Slavery Abolition Act, setting a course that would, in time, make the purchase and ownership of slaves illegal across the British Empire.</p>\n<p>In recent years, Eric Williams’ slightly grumpy comment that ‘The British historians write almost as if Britain had introduced Negro slavery solely for the satisfaction of abolishing it’ has been cited frequently in order to diminish the centrality of white abolitionists within contemporary stories told about slavery and it abolition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> While aspects of Williams’ criticism are certainly valid, and are a version of criticisms applied to Whig history in general,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> any decision to abolish slavery is ultimately a decision about the kinds of people we imagine ourselves to be and the society we would like to live in – a point made David Graeber and David Wengrow in making the case for multiple abolitions of slavery in the course of human history in their 2021 book <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In a 1920 essay on ‘The Nation’, Marcel Mauss suggested that ‘Societies live by borrowing from each other, but they define themselves rather by the refusal of borrowing than by its acceptance’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The British abolition of slavery was arguably just such a refusal, providing a defining moment for the newly enfranchised British middle classes, who, at least initially, defined themselves largely in opposition to the aristocratic and plutocratic 1% who had previously governed them, and who had been the major beneficiaries of the economic system established to enable the Trans-Atlantic trade.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Boyd Hilton has characterised Britain’s <em>Age of Atonement</em> between 1785 and 1865 in relation to a theology of Grace, centred on the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> It also involved a project of national atonement, at least partly in relation to Britain’s earlier enthusiastic participation in slave trading. Just as the script of conversion required a recognition of earlier sinfulness and redemption through acceptance of divine Grace, so conversion of the nation entailed the recognition of sin – what John Newton, an active participant in the slave trade before becoming a powerful voice in the early abolition movement called ‘this stain on our National character’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although slavery and its legacies remain largely offstage in George Eliot’s <em>Middlemarch</em>, apart from Will Ladislaw’s declaration that he intends to take up Wilberforce’s cause of ‘Negro Emancipation’, it is surely significant that money and its sources recurs as a theme throughout the novel, exemplified in the ‘ill-gotten’ fortune of the country financier Bulstrode. While this ultimately derived from a pawnbroking business, which profited from stolen goods and the distress of ‘lost souls’, many fortunes in contemporary British society were built on foundations of slavery.</p>\n<p>While the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex’ involved a great deal of ‘othering’ in relation to what Ellis called ‘the actual degradation of the heathen’, the point was surely to demonstrate the possibility of reform and ultimately of redemption.</p>\n<p>If heterotopias are, in Foucault’s terms, ‘counter-sites’, then the places of display constituted by the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex provided a kind of fulcrum around which a re-formation of the self could be attempted. In seeking to rescue the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex from ‘the enormous condescension of posterity’, it becomes necessary to demonstrate the multiple ways in which it was implicated within projects of societal reform and improvement, the consequences of which continue to have global implications.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1938, on the eve of the Second World War, just as other European Jews were being denied their political personhood and associated rights, the great French Anthropologist Marcel Mauss gave the Huxley Memorial Lecture in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He attempted to lay out developing constructions of political citizenship, what he called the Category of the Person, ‘from the simple masquerade to the mask, from a ‘role’ (<em>personnage</em>) to a ‘person’ (<em>personne</em>), to a name, to an individual’ – taking in Roman legal distinctions between citizens and slaves, as well as a recognition of the conscious moral person among the Stoics and early Christians.</p>\n<p>In the context of understanding an equation made in in recent times between political personhood and consciousness, he suggested:</p>\n<p>We cannot exaggerate the importance of sectarian movements throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for the formation of political and philosophical thought. There it was that were posed the questions regarding individual liberty, regarding the individual conscience and the right to communicate directly with God, to be one’s own priest, to have an inner God. The ideas of the Moravian Brothers, the Puritans, the Wesleyans and the Pietists are those which form the basis on which is established the notion: the ‘person’ (<em>personne)</em> equals the ‘self’ (<em>moi)</em>; the ‘self; (<em>moi</em>) equals consciousness (<em>conscience)</em>, and is its primordial category.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In concluding his lecture, Mauss asked whether ‘the sacred character of the human ‘person’ (<em>personne</em>)’ would continue to be recognised, suggesting its moral force was questioned throughout Asia, as well as in the countries where the principle was discovered (a reference to contemporary Germany). He then commented ‘We have great possessions to defend, with us the idea could disappear’ before resuming a more scientific attitude, ‘Let’s not moralise’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>To be socially recognised as a person is to be literally enfranchised – granted a  role in the political and judicial decisions of one’s society. Britain’s 1832 expansion of the political franchise was a watershed moment in the process of renegotiating what it meant to be a political and legal person – a literal re-constitution of society. It is significant that political reform ‘at home’ essentially coincided with the granting of equivalent rights to free colonised people at the Cape, as well as the abolition of slavery across the British colonies, all achievements in which newly powerful evangelical networks were significantly implicated.</p>\n<p>What 1832 allows us to see is nothing less than the beginnings of an institutional re-formation of society around a new conception of the person – the self conscious rights-bearing individual – who would also acquire, in Foucault’s terms, the ‘right to her or his own little box for her or his own little personal decay’. If the municipal cemetery, relocated to the outskirts of town, is one type of heterotopia reflecting this transformation, then the centrally located public museum, confining and displaying singular labelled objects within glass boxes, is another.</p>\n<p>Within the Missionary Exhibitionary Complex, however, it was the converted Polynesians of Tahiti, the Cook Islands and Hawai’i, rather than the contemporary British or French, who were initially framed as exemplary ‘moderns’. They had freed themselves from the demands of troublesome ancestors and ‘false gods’, now consigned to the Missionary Museum, in order to re-construct their societies around a Christian conception of God. Contemporary evangelicals presumably recognised that in 1832, this project remained a work in progress within Europe itself.</p>\n<p>On 5 May 1834, Wilhelm Richter, a tutor at the Rhenish Mission College in Barmen wrote to tell William Ellis in London that:</p>\n<p>The valuable presents you maid [sic] to our Society have contributed very much indeed to awaken the missionary spirit among us; even people who formerly did not a all care about missionary cares, came to see the Idols etc., and have a good deal of money, being very much struck with the blindness of the poor Heathen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fnref62\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">62</a></sup></p>\n<p>In October of the same year, Leipoldt himself ended a letter to Ellis by asking for ‘more curiosities out of the heathen world, as our people take a very great interest in shares idols and other curiosities which you kindly have sent to us some years ago’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Among the congregations supporting the Rhenish Missionary Society at the time was a young teenage boy, whose father owned a textile factory. Published when he was nineteen, his <em>Letters from Wuppertal</em> described the consequences of industrialisation in the Wupper valley around Barmen, as well as the contradictions of the bourgeois hypocrisy in which he had been raised:</p>\n<p>For it is a fact that the pietists among the factory owners treat their workers worst of all; they use every possible means to reduce the workers’ wages on the pretext of denying them of the opportunity to get drunk, yet at the election of preachers they are always the first to bribe their people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In his subsequent description of the <em>Condition of the Working Class in England,</em> first published in 1845, Friedrich Engels told his German-speaking readers that:</p>\n<p>The Industrial Revolution is of the same importance for England as the political revolution for France, and the philosophical revolution for Germany; and the difference between England in 1760 and in 1844 is at least as great as that between France under the <em>ancient r_é_gime</em> and during the revolution of July. But the mightiest result of the industrial transformation is the English proletariat.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Subsequently collaborating with and supporting another Rhenish boy, Karl Marx, Engels seems to have imbibed the missionary message that fetishes and idols were a bad thing, but increasingly directed this critique at European industrial society itself.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>I am extremely grateful to Rachel Hand for drawing my attention to donation of missionary material to the Royal Dublin Society, as well as to Christoph Schwab, Curator at the Archiv- und Museumsstiftung der VEM in Wuppertal, for sharing a scanned copy of the letter from Ellis, together with the list with which this chapter begins. It was such unanticipated connections that demonstrated some of the ways in which an ‘imagined community’ of evangelicals and their Missionary Exhibitionary Complex transcended political borders.</p>\n<p>I am also grateful to David Wengrow for a long friendship, extending back to an excavation in Lesotho in 1998. His 2021 book with David Graeber, <em>The Dawn of Everything</em>, has stimulated me to reflect in this chapter on the peculiarity of British configurations of political subjecthood, as well as their global implications.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div><section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Parts of a letter he had sent to the Rev.

Charles Mead, who returned to England soon afterwards, they represented Pattera-Kalee (Bhadrakali) and Veerapathiran (Virabhadra), female and male emanations of the wrath of Shiva, with ‘faces painted to give them a terrific appearance’. Their faces were soon removed with an Indian spade (mamatee). While paid labourers cleared ‘the rubbish’:</p>\n<p>We retired to the veranda of the temple, sung a Tamil hymn, read the 10<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, addressed the people from the 20<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> verse, and concluded with prayer. The people were delighted with the overthrow of the the idols; and subsequently began daily to assemble to hear the Scriptures read, and to join in prayer, where satanic worship was once performed. After the service was over, the image of Paramasattee was brought out of an adjoining room, and we rescued it from the flames with a view of bringing it to England, where it has safely arrived.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Returning to his Mission House at Neyoor (Neyyoor) ‘before the sun was very powerful’, Mead found that Martha and Charles Mault, fellow missionaries from Nagercoil just over 8 miles away, had come to see him before he left:</p>\n<p>When reviewing what the Gospel had effected for Travancore, since we first entered the field, we could not avoid saying, and our friends in Britain will join in the exclamation, ‘What hath God wrought!’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mead clearly detected the hand of God in the changes he had seen over two decades in India, regarding his own part in these as contributing to a long-term war against what he called ‘satanic worship’. Indeed, the verse he preached from at the temple comes from a letter that was written by St Paul to the people of Corinth during the first century AD.</p>\n<p>It warns them not to consume sacrifices made at idolatrous altars, since these had been made to demons. Pointing out that consumption of the eucharist underlies the fellowship of Christians, Paul told the Corinthians ‘I would not that ye should have fellowship with demons’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Charles Mead had originally been appointed to succeed William Tobias Ringeltaube, a Prussian minister trained at the University of Halle who established the London Missionary Society’s mission in South India. Born in 1770, Ringeltaube’s missionary ambitions were inspired by John Newton (Chapter 2 &amp; 12), going first to Calcutta in 1796 with the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He returned to Europe in 1799, complaining that he had been forced to preach in Portuguese to ‘a mixed congregation of Portuguese, Malays, Jews and Chinese’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ringeltaube was appointed by the London Missionary Society in 1803, along with four others intended for India and Ceylon (Sri Lanka). They arrived at the Danish colony of Tranquebar (Tharangambadi) in December 1804, where Pietist missionaries had been operating since 1706. Seeking guidance from another German-speaking SPCK missionary, John Caspar Kohlhoff, Ringeltaube began learning Tamil before taking responsibility for Palamcottah (Palayamkottai) in Tinnevelly (Tirunelveli), on behalf of Kohlhoff.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Around this time, Kohlhoff seems to have introduced Ringeltaube to Maharasan Vedamanickam, a Christian convert he had baptised some years earlier. Vedaminanickam came from Mylaudy (Mayiladi) in the Kingdom of Travancore (now part of Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari district), close to India’s southern tip. Ringeltaube began paying regular visits to Vedamanickam’s village, ultimately assisting him to begin to build a Church in 1809.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Kingdom of Travancore had been in a subsidiary alliance with the British East India Company since 1795, but conflict over a new treaty in 1805 enabled the Company to consolidate its influence. The Company’s resident, Colin Macaulay, was the son of a Church of Scotland minister and brother to Zachary Macaulay, one of the leaders of the evangelical campaign to abolish slavery in London. It was presumably Colin Macaulay who negotiated with the Maharaja of Travancore for the permission for  Vedamanickam’s church.</p>\n<p>In 1812, Ringeltaube moved to Mylaudy, but facing health problems, in 1816 he ordained Vedamanickam and sailed to Ceylon. He evidently planned to recover in South Africa, but seems to have died en route.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Although Mead never met Ringeltaube, it was into his shoes that he stepped when he arrived in late 1817, his first wife having died on the journey.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He found the Church had thrived under Vedamanickam’s care, with seven chapels, five or six schools and around 900 converts and candidates for baptism.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Macauley had been replaced as the Company’s local resident in 1810 by another reforming Scot, John Munro, who was appointed Dewan (Prime Minister) of the Kingdom of Travancore between 1811 and 1814. Munro retained considerable influence at the court, and persuaded the young Rani (Queen Regent), Gowri Parvati Bayi, to provide Mead with a bungalow at Nagercoil, four miles from Myladi, as well as 5000 rupees to purchase rice fields to support the seminary he proposed to establish.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This patronage formed part of the official embrace of missionary education by the Kingdom of Travancore, in parallel with the 1813 alteration to the East India Company’s charter (Chapter 6), which had introduced an obligation to introduce ‘useful knowledge’ as well as ‘religious and moral improvement’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1819, Mead was joined at Nagercoil by Charles and Martha Mault (née Mead, who evidently traced her descent from Britain’s seventeenth century Puritan leader, Oliver Cromwell).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Charles Mead and Charles Mault divided responsibility for surrounding villages between them, but it was only after the visit of George Bennet and Daniel Tyerman in 1827 (more below) that Mead moved to Neyoor, in the mission’s Western division.</p>\n<p>​An image of ‘Pattera-Kalee and Veerapathiran’ was printed on the cover of the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> in September 1837, under the title ’Demon Worship in South Travancore’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Mead’s account of destruction, quoted above, was printed beneath this image, but its source is unclear since the figures are shown standing, while his description suggests those destroyed were reclining.</p>\n<p>The appearance of such images on the title page of the <em>Chronicle</em> was a fairly recent innovation. Although the quarterly <em>Missionary Sketches</em> had featured striking images on its covers since its first issue in April 1818 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>), the monthly <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> continued to feature just a single portrait each month, a practice established with the magazine in 1793 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a>). This had continued even after its title expanded to <em>The Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle</em> when a distinct <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> section was added at the end of the magazine in June 1813.</p>\n<p>In June 1836, however, an editorial addressed ‘To the Members and Friends of the London Missionary Society’ appeared under a banner, <em>The Missionary Magazine and Chronicle (relating chiefly to the Missions of the London Missionary Society)</em>. This stated that the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> would now be made available independently, but still continue as the final section in <em>the Evangelical Magazine</em>. Some surviving copies of <em>the Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> after this date have different page numbers to those included with <em>the Evangelical Magazine,</em> as well as an issue number and date included as a header (compare the covers for 1836 to those from 1837 shown here), but otherwise appear to be identical.</p>\n<p>A significant change introduced in 1836, however, was the addition of a cover image for the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle.</em> The first image, for July 1836, shows a rather dramatic scene at Kristnapore, a Missionary Station in Bengal, with the title ‘Peril from the Boa Constrictor’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Flooding caused by hurricanes seems to have displaced an eighteen foot long snake into the mission compound, where it was rather dramatically killed and its skin sent to the Missionary Museum in London.</p>\n<p>The October 1836 cover featured a depiction of ‘Worship of the Serpent in India’, followed in March 1837 by an image of ‘Serpent Charmers’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> It seems likely that this recurring serpentine theme may have been initiated by an issue of <em>Missionary Sketches</em> back in April 1833, where the cover featured ‘Representations of the Serpent-God Worshipped in India’, with images of two carvings from the Missionary Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>That on the left, where ‘the hood of the serpent forms a kind of screen behind and canopy over the form of the idol’, was sent by John Hands, LMS missionary at Bellary (Ballari) between 1810 and 1841. The other,  ‘designated <em>Nagur Swamy</em> [Naga Swamy], the serpent-god, is among the renounced idols that have recently arrived from Travancore’.</p>\n<p>The text which follows begins by declaring that ’The serpent appears to have been one of the earliest objects of idolatrous worship, and has been held in universal veneration’. From the ‘mythology of the Chaldeans and Egyptians’ to the ‘uncivilised aborigines of South America’, the serpent was declared to have been ‘regarded with superstitious reverence by a large portion of the human race, especially in the eastern parts of the world’, with the <em>Naga</em> described as ‘among the thirty thousand imaginary gods of India’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The text then includes a description of Daniel Tyerman and George Bennet’s visit to a temple in Allahabad in August 1826, where they encountered an ‘idol’ in the form of a five headed serpent. It explained that Nagercoil, the location for the main LMS mission in South Travancore, literally translated means temple of the serpent. Visited by Tyerman and Bennet in July 1827, their account of the weekly feeding of resident snakes by priests was also printed, including their unsuccessful attempt to purchase one of the foot-high serpent representations from the wall of the temple. These were described as mostly ‘offerings presented by women, in consequence of vows which they have made to the god’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The text that follows notes that in the last six months of 1831, 113 families from Nagercoil had renounced Hinduism, seeking Christian instruction at mission schools now responsible for teaching between 16,000 and 17,000 students. At Neyoor, a further 3000 people were said to have ‘forsaken heathenism’, with 160 families added during 1831 alone.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While Charles Mead remained the sole European male missionary resident at Neyoor, the text explained that he was assisted by an Indian ‘superintendent of schools, fourteen readers, and twenty-six assistant readers’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Mead’s 1832 report referred ‘to the village of Paenguddy, where the inhabitants delivered up the serpent-idol, represented in the first page of this sketch’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p><em>Missionary Sketches</em> was quick to remind readers that:</p>\n<p>Every instance in which the objects of heathen veneration are either discarded or destroyed, should excite our devout thanksgiving, and impart greater fervency to prayer, while we regard it as an earnest of the arrival of that period, in which, referring to the purposes of the Most High, it is declared “the idols he shall utterly abolish.” These indicate that God is working by the means now employed for effecting this…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>An excerpt from Mead’s report summarised his efforts to establish a school house at the village of Careavilly (Kariavili) in the grounds of the temple, referred to as ‘the principal devil house in these parts next to Mundacadoo’ (Mandaikadu).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mead explained that some of the owners of the temple had converted to Christianity, and the school house was intended to become a focus for Christian worship during the evenings. He thought that the ‘Pagoda will no longer be used as a place of heathen worship’ but would either be removed or allowed to decay, suggesting that ‘the latter is thought to be the most advisable mode of rooting out idolatry from the place’. Mead explained:</p>\n<p>The heathen hold the pagoda in great veneration, and if any thing was done that looked too much like a triumph over them, it might be resented and occasion opposition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>A much bolder approach seems to have been adopted at what seems to have been the same temple a mere four years later, according to Mead’s account of destruction from the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> of 1837. The overall strategy of converting the temple into a location for Christian worship, however, seems to have remained the same.</p>\n<p>The final paragraph from <em>Missionary Sketches</em> in April 1833 provides an insight into the preoccupations of those responsible for commissioning the multiple serpentine images for LMS publications in subsequent years, suggesting:</p>\n<p>The extensive and valuable labours of the native readers, the numbers under Christian instruction… and the attentive behaviour of the native congregations in places of worship, unite to endorse on every disciple of Christ more fervent and persevering prayer, for the influences of the Holy Spirit a savour of life… and thus to accelerate the arrival of the period, when the worship of the serpent, and every other delusive idolatry promoted by the great destroyer of our race, who, under the form of a serpent, introduced sin and all its degradations and penalties to our world, shall be discontinued…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>For British Christians like Charles Mead, raised on an account of temptation and fall in which a serpent played the leading role, it must have been obvious that the reverence paid to snakes in the form of <em>Naga Swamy</em> at places like Nagercoil was a form of ‘devil worship’, indicating the ongoing influence of Satan, ‘the great destroyer of our race’.</p>\n<p>In describing the annual festival at nearby Mandaikadu in 1837, Mead emphasised that it was a ‘place of devil worship’, describing a ‘swinging machine’ which hoisted devotees using a ‘hook inserted in the back’. He described how children who had recovered from illnesses were made to dance with ‘a thin piece of cane inserted in their side’, even hinting that the resident ‘demon’ was said to require a human sacrifice every thousand years.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Missionary work, situated in this way, was understood as a contribution to a very long-term cosmic battle, in which conversions and the renunciation of ‘idols’ suggested the scales might be tipping.</p>\n<p>Mead’s account of the destruction of the ‘idols’ at Kariavili, printed in the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle in</em> September 1837_,_ was followed with news of a Memorial, presented to the Governor of Madras by over two hundred local British residents, protesting at ‘Government Support of Idolatry in India’, referred to as ‘this dark blot on the Christian character of the British nation’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The next article described the ‘Conversion of Roman Catholics at Salem’, also in South India, followed by an extract from the journal of Indian evangelists at Chittoor, as well as a ’Translation of a Sermon Preached at Benares’ (Varanasi).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The issue’s focus on India was rounded off with brief news of missions in South Africa and Berbice (now part of Guyana), as well as an anniversary Missionary meeting in Manchester that raised nearly £3,000. The magazine ended by listing a series of more modest financial ‘Missionary Contributions’, as well as letters received from overseas Missionaries.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The following month, the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> returned to ‘Demon Worship in South Travancore’, continuing Charles Mead’s ‘account of this decaying but abhorrent superstition’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> On the cover an apparently accurate image of ‘Paramasattee’ was printed, with which Mead had returned to London, imagined under a Banyan tree at night, small flames rising from the many spoon-shaped attachments attached to her front.</p>\n<p>Mead’s account resumes:</p>\n<p>The name Paramasattee literally signifies, ‘heavenly virtue, or strength.’ This demon, though frightful in appearance, is accounted no less a personage than the wife of heavenly Seevan [Shiva]. The image, which is formed of wood, was usually concealed from public view, except on great occasions, when it was brought out and worshipped in connection with Pattera-kalee [Bhadrakali]. There is a great assumption of mystery connected with the worship of this evil spirit.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mead seems to have derived much of his understanding of the function of this image from a former priest at the temple, described as ‘a very interesting man, more than seventy years of age’, who was now ‘a converted character’ following baptism as a Christian. He seems to have told the missionary that the many spoon-shaped vessels were used as lamps, holding oil and wicks, lit during temple festivals to create ‘an imposing appearance, when placed in the shade of a banyan tree, on a dark night’:</p>\n<p>These lamps are intended to represent the letters of the alphabet, which are repeated when the image is worshipped; and there are several Tamil letters carved on the image itself. Five of the letters are held as sacred and mystic, and the very repetition of them, it is said, ‘consumed the sins’ of a certain Rajah: they form the mysterious word, Na-ma-se-va-ya.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>According to Mead, when the figures of Pattera-kalee (Bhadrakali) was destroyed, the same former priest told the people:</p>\n<p>You used to come to the pagoda with your offerings, and ask me to dance before the idols until the evil spirits came on me; then I would tell you what to do. It was all false and wicked; but we did this until the Missionaries and the native teachers came to enlighten us. Now by the blessing of God our eyes are opened. Some of us have long since abandoned the devil’s service. I am glad I am no longer his slave. Let us be stedfast, and endeavour to show others the true way to salvation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While it may be tempting to regard the destruction and removal of religious artefacts as a straightforward imposition of colonialism, this probably fails to recognise the degree to which these events emerged from the actions of people like this former priest, as well as Vedamanickam, who began the process of conversion in South Travancore before European missionaries came to his village.</p>\n<p>Arriving in Britain at the end of March 1837, Charles Mead was able to attend the London Missionary Society’s Annual Public Meeting at Exeter Hall in London on 11 May. It proved to be the largest and the longest annual meeting of the Society’s four decades long history. It was attended by a fair number of people with overseas missionary experience, in China (Rev. W.H. Medhurst – Chapter 16), the Pacific (Rev. John Williams – <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>, &amp; 15), South Africa (Rev. Dr. John Philip, Rev. James Read and Jan Tzatzoe – Chapter 15 &amp; 31), Madagascar (Rev. J.J. Freeman – Chapter 19), as well as several others who had worked in India ( Rev. Richard Knill, Rev. E. Crisp, Rev. J. Crowther – a Wesleyan Methodist, Rev. George Gogerley, Rev. William Campbell).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The meeting began with a report from William Ellis, Foreign Secretary (Chapter 13), who provided a listing of the society’s missions, summarised numerically into three columns in the printed account of the meeting; ‘stations and outstations’; ‘missionaries’ and ‘assistants, native, &amp;c<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Stations and Out-Stations</th>\n<th>Missionaries</th>\n<th>Assistants, Native, &amp;c.</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>South Seas</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>70</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ultra Ganges</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>East Indies</td>\n<td>310</td>\n<td>36</td>\n<td>375</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Russia</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mediterranean</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>–</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>South Africa and African Islands</td>\n<td>31</td>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>West Indies</td>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>428</td>\n<td>114</td>\n<td>482</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These figures make it clear that the East Indies stood out in comparison to other regions, partly because of the number of ‘stations and out-stations’ (310), but especially because of the large number of ‘Assistants, Native. &amp;c.’ (375). While the second and third columns assert an essentially racial distinction between European ‘Missionaries’ and local ‘Assistants’, it is clear that in India, unlike the other regions, there were ten times more ‘Assistants’ that ‘Missionaries’. The East Indies also had the largest number of European ‘Missionaries’ (36) with seven more than in ‘South African and African Islands’ (29), but there were over 300 more ‘Assistants’ in India (375) than the South Seas (70), which has the second largest number in that column.</p>\n<p>The first person to address the Exeter Hall meeting after Ellis was James Montgomery from Sheffield, a journalist who had edited the journals made by Tyerman and Bennet as part of their deputation tour of LMS mission stations, published six years earlier. He noted the need for missionaries in the West Indies following the abolition of slavery (Chapter 18), ongoing conversions across the Pacific, the difficulties of pursuing a mission in China (Chapter 17) as well as in the ‘wilderness of South Africa’ (Chapter 16), but suggested:</p>\n<p>In India, within the last forty years, there are evidences that the chains of caste, as well as Satan’s 300,000 representatives under the name of idols will be done away there, as well as in other parts of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Next to speak was Charles Mead, reflecting on twenty years in Travancore, and the opposition he faced from ‘The Brahmins – the rich, the mighty, and the noble’. He reported that at his mission at Neyoor, a copy of the New Testament had recently been presented ‘to every native Christian on the station, who was able to read’. He also told the meeting that each of the eighty villages connected to Neyoor and Nagercoil had a place of worship and a school, with 6000 boys and 200 girls currently under instruction.</p>\n<p>At the end of his speech, Mead provided a slightly different account of the destruction at the temple in Kariavili to that printed the following September:</p>\n<p>The people wished me to attend a meeting for the purpose of destroying a large temple, containing two images. On my arrival, I found them all assembled and very much interested. They said, “The evil spirits, which these images represent, have been long troubling the neighbourhood, and several of us have for some time given up our idolatry. Now we wish these relics to be entirely removed, but no one has the courage to do it.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mead apparently told them that ‘we would have it removed’ only ‘if they could show it was their property’. He was given ‘the signatures of eighteen persons, saying they would freely give up the temple to us, to do what we pleased with it’, ending his speech with a mention of Paramassattee:</p>\n<p>The other image was a wooden idol – the people wished to burn it, but, as it was rather portable, I proposed to bring it home, telling them, that when you saw that they were casting away their idols, it would be some proof to you of their desire to become true Christians.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It seems that Christianity may have represented a new form of freedom for many converts, liberating them from inherited forms of power, including the powers of what were referred to as ‘evil spirits’. Nearly a quarter of a century later, readers of the Juvenile Missionary Magazine were told of Paramasattee, the ‘tall, curious looking wooden idol’ shown on the left of an image of the case of ‘The Buddhist and Other Idols’ at the Missionary museum, that:</p>\n<p>“Ignorant and unwise,” the simple people stare with wonder at this strange sight, and are quite ready to believed that Paramasattee is indeed a great god.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The testimony reported by Mead, however, seems clear that temple images were not regarded as gods in their own right, but rather as representations or and vessels for spirits, as in Polynesia (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/13-all-wrapped-up-in-a-piece-of-tahitian-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 13</a>). Nevertheless, there remained an understandable nervousness about being the one to wield a spade against them.</p>\n<p>On his return London, Charles Mead presented Paramasattee as a battle trophy in the cosmic war against Satan. European missionaries working in India at around this time, however, seem to have been fully aware that the adoption of Christianity by large numbers of people in South Travancore emerged from a series of far more immediate and local conflicts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The majority of early converts in Travancore belonged to caste groups that were at the time referred to as Shánar (known since 1921 as Nadar), as well as Pariah (Paraiyar). These had a fairly lowly status within the Kingdom, which was dominated by Nair (or Nayar) and Brahmin caste groups, who had developed a range of ways of asserting their status. These included various forms of compulsory labour, including at temples, but also prohibitions on lower castes wearing clothing above the waist, carrying umbrellas, wearing shoes or golden ornaments.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When converted Christian women began wearing clothing on their upper bodies, this was regarded as asserting a privilege properly reserved for the higher castes. Violent confrontations as well as legislative responses followed after 1827, and it was not until 1859 that Nadar women in Travancore gained the legal right to cover their breasts, although not in the same way at Nair women.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Concern for the lives of women seems to have become a significant dimension of early missionary work at Nagercoil, driven in no small part by the arrival of Martha Mault. She established a girl’s boarding school in 1819, although female education seems to have been regarded somewhat suspiciously, including by many new Christians converts, at least initially.</p>\n<p>In 1821, Martha Mault began to teach lace-making to her female students, after they had learned how to read and write. By 1827, there were forty girls at her school in Nagercoil, twelve learning lace-making.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Mault’s efforts have been connected to contemporary British gender ideologies of ‘women’s work’, emphasising ‘separate spheres’ as part of a ‘mission of domesticity’, but they also appear to have been underpinned by a series of fairly practical aims.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Firstly, the sale of lace created a source of income that supported the costs of running her school. Secondly, lace-making was seen as a way to enable enslaved girls to build up a financial surplus with which to purchase their liberty. Girls in this position were evidently prioritised when it came to teaching these skills, and by 1830 Martha Mault reported that eight girls had emancipated themselves in this way.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Many former students from ‘Mrs Mault’s school’ went on to become the wives of Christian ‘Native teachers’ as well as village school mistresses in their own right.  While many more boys than girls were educated at mission schools in South Travancore, Martha Mault’s educational project, combining literacy with needlework, seems to have struck a chord with women across Evangelical networks all over the world.</p>\n<p>Groups of British women came together to fund the education of particular girls – by 1830, 22 girls were supported in this way.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Some of these girls were even given names by their supporters, possibly to commemorate deceased female relatives and friends. ‘Ladies’ at St. Neots, the town in Huntingdonshire where Martha Mault grew up, raised £2 and 5 shillings each year ‘for the support of “Sarah Franklin”’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Charles Mead spoke at Exeter Hall in May 1837, he told the meeting:</p>\n<p>I have in my hand the writing of a little girl, named Elizabeth Fletcher, who is supported by the church at Stepney. It is the second Epistle of St. John, and it is written on a palmyra leaf, with an iron pen. It is novel sight in India, to witness females reading and writing, but their parents are now anxious for their instruction.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Considerable funds were also raised for Travancore schools beyond Britain. A donation of £12 from Leonora Gaussen on behalf of the ‘Ladies Association for Female Education’ in Geneva was received in November 1837,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> followed by a further £14-10 in March 1838.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Richard Knill, who initially travelled to India with Charles Mead and assisted him establish the mission at Nagercoil, was appointed as a minister at St Petersburg in Russia by the London Missionary Society after his return to London in 1820. His congregation raised funds for the Nagercoil mission,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> continuing even after Knill returned to London in 1833.</p>\n<p>A key supporter of the LMS was Sarah Biller (née Kilham), who formed part of an influential group of evangelical (and Quaker) women in the city.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Another St Petersburg Quaker, Daniel Wheeler, appointed to manage Russian imperial farms by Tsar Alexander, felt called to visit missions in the Pacific, setting off with his son in late 1833, only to return in early May 1838.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Martha Mault herself returned to Britain in September 1833, ironically perhaps, at least partly to arrange for the education of her own five children.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fnref57\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">57</a></sup> Nevertheless, she used the opportunity to raise funds and solicit interest in ‘female education’ in India.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>  Following her return to Travancore in October 1835, she arranged for a circular letter to be printed at Nagercoil, to send to her supporters.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>One of these, dated 7 September 1836, has survived in the archives of the Council for World Mission in London, having been sent to the Foreign Secretary, William Ellis. The first printed line reads ‘My dear Madam’, although the last word has been crossed out and replaced with Sir, suggesting that Ellis was probably the only male recipient of one of these letters.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mault reported that when she returned, there were 62 boarders and 10 day scholars at her school in Nagercoil, but 38 more boarders were soon added. Miss McGregor, who returned with her in 1835 in order to marry the missionary Charles Miller, soon established her own school at Neyoor with a further 35 students. Mault reported that by September 1836, they had between them 145 girls ‘under our immediate inspection’, with a similar number taught at village schools.</p>\n<p>The circular acknowledges that ‘most of the higher castes are still averse to having their daughters instructed’ but suggested that ‘as the benefits of education become more apparent by its wider diffusion among the lower ranks, the higher will be compelled to educate their daughters too’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The final paragraphs of the letter explained that each girl was instructed for four years, unless they needed to stay longer, but that ‘the simplicity of their food and dress enables us to keep a girl at the trifling expense of forty five shillings per annum’.</p>\n<p>Following their visit to Nagercoil in 1827,  George Bennet and Daniel Tyerman noted:</p>\n<p>We are most highly gratified with the state of the general aspect of this Mission… There is nothing, as far as we have seen, equal to it in all India, and we were strongly reminded of what we had so often witnessed in the South Seas.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>They also noted:</p>\n<p>The girls’ school, under the care of Mrs. Mault (of whom we cannot speak too highly), is in an excellent state, and does her exertions much credit. Twelve of these girls learn to make lace, some of which is exceedingly well done…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although Tyerman and Bennet were thwarted when they attempted to acquire an ‘idol’ at the temple in Nagercoil, they do seem to have been presented with a sample of locally made lace by Martha Mault. It survived, pinned to a note written by George Bennet describing its source, at the headquarters of the Council for World Mission in London, where I encountered it in August 2010.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As an artefact, this fragment, now at the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich in London (Chapter 32), has the potential to say at least as much about the early Travancore  mission, with its complex and changing dynamics of caste and gender, as the figure of Paramasattee, now kept on the other side of the river Thames, at the British Museum.</p>\n<p>It finds a curious echo in a length of lace from the collection of the V&amp;A Museum in South Kensington, where a printed green label states ‘London Missionary Society, Lace Industry, Nagercoil, S. India’ (<a href=\"https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O315374/insertion-unknown/\" target=\"_blank\">V&amp;A T.195-1993</a>). Below this, a hand-written price in Rupees suggests that it was purchased in India, perhaps with the intention of using it as a decorative edging. How many other examples of Nagercoil lace survive in museum collections, without such labels, incorporated into other garments?</p>\n<p>Annette Weiner, who undertook doctoral fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands, six decades after Bronislaw Malinowski, found he had significantly underestimated the role played by women in the Kula exchange system, described in his famous 1922 book <em>Argonauts of the Western Pacific.</em> While men were concerned with enhancing their status through the exchange of shell valuables, women developed an elaborate technology for ‘making wealth out of dried banana leaves’, which Weiner came to regard as paralleled by female practices of textile production all over the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Introducting her 1992 theoretical book, <em>Inalienable Possessions</em>, Weiner suggested that:</p>\n<p>In many societies throughout the world, however, women are the producers and, in part or wholly, the controllers of highly valued possessions – a currency of sorts made from “cloth”. Intricate symbolic meanings semantically encode sexuality, biological reproduction, and nurturance so that such possessions, as they are exchanged between people, act as the material agents in the reproduction of social relations….<br>\nHistorically, women’s control over these arenas has accorded them powers associated with magical potency, sacred prerogatives, political legitimacy, and life-giving and life-taking social controls.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Lace making in England, like the production of banana leaf fibres in the Trobriands, can be regarded as involving the production of ‘a currency of sorts made from “cloth”’. In the East of England, where Martha Mault came from, lace-making was linked to the history of Protestantism, having arrived with French and Flemish refugees from continental wars of religion during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>\n<p>Lace formed an important and valuable part of middle-class female dress, with inherited items of ‘antique lace’ treasured as family heirlooms, playing a role in key English life-cycle ceremonies – baptisms, weddings and funerals. During the nineteenth century, although lace making was increasingly mechanised, making lace by hand survived ‘as a means of occupying spare time’ among middle class women.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Indeed, work produced in this way was increasingly sold to generate funds to support missionary work.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Alongside a description of mechanised lace-making in Nottingham, Derby and Leicester, Friedrich Engels observed in 1844 that hand-made lace continued to be commercially produced in Northampton, Oxford and Bedford, where lace ‘schools’, effectively small-scale workshops, exploited the children of the poor. Summarising, he suggested:</p>\n<p>This is the price at which society purchases for the fine ladies of the bourgeoisie the pleasure of wearing lace; a reasonable price truly! Only a few thousand blind working men, some consumptive labourers’ daughters, a sickly generation of the vile multitude bequeathing its debility to its equally “vile” children and children’s children.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Did the introduction of lace-making in South Travancore simply mark the expansion of similar forms of exploitation to an Indian context? A century later, Mahatma Gandhi deployed the production of Khadi cloth by hand as a symbol of dignity in labour as part of the <em>swadeshi</em> movement. Is it implausible to suggest that lace-making as form of economic self-empowerment within the female-directed educational setting of ‘Mrs Mault’s school’ at Nagercoil, suggests something similar may have been at play in missionary contexts?</p>\n<p>At the end of her book <em>Inalienable Possessions</em>, Annette Weiner argued that:</p>\n<p>Understanding the scope and limits of gender-based power in the ethnographic record demands giving serious attention to the essential domains in which women participate in economic and political actions in their own right with their own resources. Since the ethnographic examples from which traditional economic theories are formulated rely almost exclusively on examples of men’s production and men’s exchanges, the reproductive energies in such things as women’s bones, sacred cloth, hair strings, banana-leaf bundles, weaving poles, and birthing houses, are largely unrecognised or, when recorded, are reduced by anthropologists to prosaic categories lacking economic or political provenience.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In moving from the destruction of temple sculptures to the production of lace, I have attempted to demonstrate some of the ways in which these seemingly distinct practices remained intimately connected. The transformations associated with the widespread adoption of Christianity by marginalised castes in South Travancore pitted the temple, a focus for existing ideas and practices surrounding fertility, where many dedications were evidently made by women, against the school, where at least some women gained new forms of economic power, clothing their bodies in new ways to challenge entrenched forms of hierarchy.</p>\n<p>With a focus on the Pacific, Annette Weiner noted ‘many examples of gender complementarity between women and men in terms of hard and soft (cloth) possessions, weaving and warfare’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This interplay is powerfully represented by the <em>ki’iki’i</em> from Rarotonga (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>), which brings a hard wooden core together with soft barkcloth wrappings, just as the <em>to’o</em> from Tahiti (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/idol-gods-of-otaheite/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 4</a>) combine a wooden core with woven and feather wrappings.</p>\n<p>The paired temple figures of Bhadrakali and Virabhadra, their hard bodies clothed by soft woven fabric, suggests that similar notions of gender complementarity formed part of South Indian religious conceptions, although the introduction of education for girls, even in a kingdom dominated by the famously matrilineal Nair caste, marked a new departure in gender relations.</p>\n<p>Weiner suggested that to read such examples of complementarity as oppositions between male and female ‘is to miss entirely the commingling of symbols and actions that define the political domain for men and women in terms of reproducing relationships and possessions in the face of loss’. Cloth, she suggested, with its ‘acts of tying and unravelling, sacred threads and dangerous dyes, woven warps and unworked woofs’,  ‘may be the most apt metaphor to visualise… expressions of longed for unity juxtaposed against the realities of death, destruction, and change.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>If the early mass conversions at Nagercoil were to be followed by the establishment of a Christian society, able to reproduce itself through subsequent generations, schools seem to have provided the institutional form through which its members could be produced. Martha Mault and Charles Mead arguably represent complementary poles underpinning the establishment of this new dispensation in South Travancore, at least when they represented it to supporters elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>At a number of seminars where I have presented initial drafts of some of my work, particularly at the Institute of Historical Research’s Christian Missions in Global History Seminar, I have been asked to say more about the role of women in missionary collecting. This chapter is an initial attempt to respond to these prompts.</p>\n<p>In writing about lace, I was reminded of the late Hélène La Rue, who impressed on me the importance of lace during the year I worked with her on the <em>Other Within Project</em> at the Pitt Rivers Museum, shortly before she passed away. I was interested to find that Nicolette Makovicky and David Hopkin, who were also involved in that project have subsequently developed the <a href=\"https://laceincontext.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Lace in Context</em></a> project, which helpfully pointed me towards the Illustrated London News article of 1859.</p>\n<p>I have already acknowledged the influence of those who taught me about South Asian religion and its history, but in writing this chapter, I couldn’t help but be reminded of a tutorial spent discussing ‘Nayar Marriage’, and whether it really counted as marriage, with Nick Allen.</p>\n<p>It seems important to also acknowledge the influence of my students, in conversation with whom I have also learnt a great deal. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Gréine Jordan, whose PhD on the images within the Juvenile Missionary Magazine was submitted just before this chapter was written. My interest in the images used by Missionary periodicals, which finds its way into this chapter, has been stimulated in no small part through supervising her dissertation.</p>\n<p>I would also like to acknowledge Aayushi Gupta, with whom I had a number of extremely stimulating conversations about female Zenana missions in India while she was developing her PhD proposal. This chapter is intended to offer something of a prehistory for that movement.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Contemporary orthography would render this as Kariavili near Mandaikadu</p>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> (1837) Demon Worship in South Travancore, <em>The Missionary Magazine and Chronicle, September 1837, pp. 441-444: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical%20magazine%20and%20missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical magazine and missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></em></p>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> (1837) Demon Worship in South Travancore, <em>The Missionary Magazine and Chronicle, September 1837, p. 443: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical%20magazine%20and%20missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical magazine and missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></em></p>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> (1837) Demon Worship in South Travancore, <em>The Missionary Magazine and Chronicle, September 1837, p. 444: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical%20magazine%20and%20missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zfUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical magazine and missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></em></p>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> 1 Corinthians 10, 14-22: Authorised King James Version.

The ‘multitudes who had assembled to witness their departure, and to testify their interest in the important enterprise’ cheered in response, ‘the ladies waving their handkerchiefs’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Since his return to London in a whaling ship in June 1834, Williams had toured the country, speaking to missionary meetings about his eighteen years in the Pacific. His <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises in the South Sea Islands,</em> describing events including the conversions of Rurutu, Rarotonga and Aitutaki (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>), had been a sensation following its publication a year earlier.</p>\n<p>When it became clear, in December 1837, that the Government would not provide Williams with a ship, he set about raising the necessary funds himself. By January, there was enough to purchase the <em>Camden</em>, a 200 ton, eighteen year old former postal vessel. By the end of March, the <em>Camden</em> had been repaired and fitted up by Fletcher’s boatyard in Poplar, without charge, with a total of £4000 raised in support. This included £500 from the Court of Common Council of the City of London, on the grounds that Missionary work opened the way to British commerce.</p>\n<p>John Williams was the man of the moment and his departure seemed to mark an opening into history. As a new Queen, Victoria, awaited her coronation (on 28 June), the proliferation of steamships and railways across the Kingdom had raised British confidence to new heights. Williams’ biographer and friend, Ebenezer Prout, remembered five years later that:</p>\n<p>To the eye of hope, the future was as bright as the present; not a cloud darkened the horizon, and all seemed to anticipate the day when they would hear of fresh triumphs which he would be honoured to win for the truth and grace of the Lord Jesus.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>George Baxter, who had illustrated Williams’ book, was waiting to document the moment the <em>Camden</em> set sail. Three years earlier he had patented a new technique for printing colour images, used for the frontispiece in Williams’ book, which showed ‘Te Po, a Chief of Rarotonga’ (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>), at least in the early editions. When John Snow, the publisher, found he could sell the portrait of John Williams that replaced this in later editions independently, he encouraged Baxter to try something new.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As the paddle steamer approached the <em>Camden</em>, anchored at Gravesend in Kent, the passengers gathered on deck to sing hymns, written for the occasion. They lowered their eyes for prayers, offered by the Rev. T. Jackson, the only surviving Director of the Society who had witnessed the departure of the <em>Duff</em>, just over four decades earlier (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-cession-of-matavai/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 1</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ten missionaries, eight missionary wives, as well as the eldest son of John Williams together with his new wife transferred to the <em>Camden,</em> and Baxter sketched the moment the final sail unfurled as the <em>Camden</em> began to move, water lapping at her bow. For around ten miles, the <em>City of Canterbury</em> continued beside the <em>Camden</em>, allowing him time to finish the sketch, including details of the fully laden ship, with three flags flying from her masts.</p>\n<p>That on the fore-mast carried the Society’s emblem – a dove with a green sprig in its beak and that at the stern features the word ‘Bethel’, ‘house of God’ in Hebrew, the name given by Jacob to the place he dreamed of a stairway stretching between Heaven and Earth.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Atop the main-mast, the highest point of the ship, the words on the flag are harder to make out, partly because they are reversed in the colour image and partly because they are not English words. The ‘Ladies of Rev. W. Woodhouse’s congregation, Swansea’ had made a flag for the Camden with the Welsh inscription <em>Cenad Hedd</em>, meaning ‘Messenger of Peace’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Baxter worked quickly, turning his sketch into an engraving for the cover of the following month’s <em>Missionary Magazine</em>. It was also used on the title page of <em>The Missionary’s Farewell; Valedictory Services of the Rev. John Williams, previous to his Departure for the South Seas,</em> bringing together the speeches and hymns, with an account of the events of the day.</p>\n<p>There the image of the <em>Camden</em> was printed above a caption ‘<em>And they accompanied him unto the ship</em>’, a quotation from the Acts of the Apostles (20:38), in which Paul addressed the Ephesians at Miletus, since they ‘would see his face no more’. Reviewers of Williams’ book had similarly connected it to the New Testament, declaring it to be a ‘a history of Gospel propagation, unequalled by any similar narrative since the Acts of the Apostles’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In <em>Farewell to Viriamu</em> (the Tahitian version of Williams’ name), a booklet given to those on the <em>City of Canterbury</em>, the first hymn referred to Williams as ‘APOSTLE OF THE ISLES’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The text which followed Baxter’s engraving in the May 1838 <em>Missionary Magazine</em> declared the significance of his departure in national rather than biblical terms:</p>\n<p>England stands pre-eminent among the nations of the earth as a maritime power… But never, since the departure of the Duff, has a vessel left our shores under circumstances and for objects entirely similar to those which have marked the departure of the Camden.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>If John Williams was a living Apostle, following a path set by St. Paul, his departure in the <em>Camden</em> demanded commemoration. Working with John Snow, the publisher of <em>Missionary Enterprises,</em> who, together with Prout, remained with Williams on the <em>Camden</em> until it left English waters a week later, Baxter created a colour print to be sold in its own right.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Adverts at the front of Snow’s publications listed this alongside his books as follows:</p>\n<p>Dedicated to the London Missionary Society, price 4s.</p>\n<p>A SPLENDID COLOURED PRINT,</p>\n<p>Representing the Departure of the CAMDEN Missionary Ship, with the Rev. J. WILLIAMS and Missionaries for the South Seas, from the River Thames; sketched on the spot, and printed in Oil Colours by G. BAXTER, Patentee. Size of Print, including tinted board, 10 inches by 14 inches.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The board on which the print was mounted included many of the same details, as well as a title in bold letters, <strong>The Departure of the Camden, Missionary Ship,</strong> the title of this chapter.</p>\n<p>In creating the colour image, Baxter added the <em>City of Canterbury</em> to the right of the <em>Camden</em>, its smoke blowing with the wind.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Comparing the colour image to its black and white precursors suggests that Baxter also added the boats in the foreground, filled with supporters waving hats and handkerchiefs. The way the departing ship is framed by these appears to suggest the <em>Camden’s</em> sails were filled with their cheers, and no doubt prayers, of supporters across the British Isles.</p>\n<p>For John Williams, the departure of the <em>Camden</em> marked just the latest in a series of ambitious maritime voyages. Having regarded the forced sale of the <em>Endeavour</em> in 1823 as a victory for Satan (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>), when left without a ship at Rarotonga in May 1827, he decided to improvise.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams began a ship building project soon after he returned to Avarua in July 1827, with the support and assistance of the local ruler, Makea Pori. This must have strained locally available resources, unfolding in parallel to church building projects (Chapter 12), suggesting it was also important to Makea.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When a European ship finally arrived at the island in November 1827, Williams wrote to William Ellis in London, telling him about their efforts:</p>\n<p>She is built entirely of <em>tamanu</em>, and about fifty or sixty tons, quite sharp. We have been three months about her, and intend to launch her next week, and start for Raiatea. I call her “The Messenger of Peace”. My first projected voyage is to take not less than twelve native teachers to different islands, go to the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, &amp;c. If you can incline the Directors to give me copper for her, I shall be obliged.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In his <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises,</em> Williams described the construction of the two masted schooner, improvising a set of bellows, cutting trees with locally made adzes, and using locally made bark cloth to fill gaps between the planks. Rope was made from hibiscus and sails from sleeping mats. According to Ebenezer Prout, who edited the book:</p>\n<p>It has been frequently said that his own “Narrative of Missionary Enterprises,” is invested with all the romantic interest which belongs to the fictitious “Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,” with the additional power derived from its truth. But it must be confessed that the portion of this work which describes the building of his ship, possesses a fascination altogether peculiar… Defoe never ascribed to the hero of his romance any achievement so wonderful.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>We should remember, however, that while Robinson Crusoe only had “Man Friday” to help him, Williams use of the pronoun ‘we’ included hundreds of experienced Rarotongan canoe builders.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The first attempt to sail the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> resulted in a broken foremast, but after repairs were made, her first voyage was to Aitutaki, 170 miles away, accompanied by ‘the king, Makea’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Like Kamehameha in Hawai’i (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/principal-kinds-of-native-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 7</a>), Makea seems to have immediately grasped how such a vessel could extend his exchange relationships and enhance his status.</p>\n<p>The <em>Messenger of Peace</em> returned to Rarotonga with a cargo of pigs, coconuts and cats (Rarotonga having been overrun by rats), as well as ‘a considerable quantity of native cloth and mats, which are highly esteemed, and of considerable value at Rarotonga’, obtained by Makea at Aitutaki.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Shortly after their return to Rarotonga, a new missionary, Aaron Buzacott, arrived, bringing with him iron to strengthen the ship. He also brought letters from Ra’iatea, telling Williams that Tuahine, the Tahitian deacon he had left in charge, one of the earliest converts at Tahiti who had assisted Henry Nott to translate the bible into Tahitian, had died.</p>\n<p>Stopping at Papeete harbour at Tahiti, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> sailed to Raiatea, arriving on 26 April 1828, in time for the annual missionary meeting. Makea, who joined the voyage, oversaw ‘the exhibition of the rejected idols of his people’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He then spent two months visiting the important men on the islands of Raiatea, Tahaa and Borabora, with whom he exchanged gifts.</p>\n<p>Despite Makea’s obvious investment in the <em>Messenger of Peace</em>, John Williams’ <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises</em> established the archetype of the shipbuilding missionary, seemingly able to conjure up a vessel with his own bare hands – an association that endured for over a century (Chapter 23).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>From Ra’iatea, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> delivered Polynesian missionaries to the Marquesas Islands and on her return was fitted with further ironwork, sent by congregations in Birmingham. She was also painted with green paint supplied by the captain of the <em>Seringapatam</em>, a visiting British naval frigate.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In May 1830, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> embarked on another journey, to what, at the time, were called the Navigators Islands (now the Samoan Islands), stopping in the Cook Islands, where an epidemic was raging. Williams described leaving Aitutaki with ‘ten native Missionaries’ on board, and hoisting ‘our beautiful flag, whose dove and olive-branch were emblematical both of our name and object’ – a note in Williams’ book acknowledging the flag had been made and sent to the Pacific ’by some kind ladies at Brighton… with the work of their own hands’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Stopping at Niue, where they attempted to leave teachers from Aitutaki, an older man came aboard, but when Polynesian evangelists attempted to cover his nakedness,  wrapping a piece of bark cloth around his body, he tore it off, exclaiming:</p>\n<p>Am I a woman, that I should be encumbered with that stuff?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>From Niue, they sailed to Tonga, where Wesleyan missionaries had been working since 1826. During a visit to their mission at Nuku’alofa, it was agreed that Fiji, with its political connections to Tonga, should become a province of the Wesleyan mission.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Travelling to Vava’u,and Ha’apai with the Wesleyans, Williams was shown a <em>marae</em> where five ‘gods, disrobed of their apparel’ were ‘hanging in degradation like so many condemned criminals’. He asked to be given one of these, which he took to England ‘with the very string around its neck by which it was hung’, where George Baxter used it to make an illustration for his book.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At Nuku’alofa, they also met Fauea, a high status Samoan man who had been at Tonga eleven years, who promised to make the necessary introductions if they took him and his wife back to Samoa. As a result, they were warmly received at Savai’i in August 1830. Presents were exchanged with Mālietoa Vainu‘upo and his brother Taimalelagi who were in the ascendent, including:</p>\n<p>one red and one white shirt, six or eight yards of English print, three axes, three hatchets, a few strings of sky blue-bead, some knives, two or three pairs of scissors, a few small looking-glasses, hammers, chisels, gimlets, fish-hooks, and some nails.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Leaving Polynesian missionaries at Samoa, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> sailed to Raiatea, before returning to Rarotonga in September 1831. There the vessel was repaired and lengthened by Makea while Williams worked on translating the gospel into Rarotongan. While there, an extremely destructive hurricane drove the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> onto the shore, and although she survived, seventy sheets of copper were lost. Williams was able to distribute tools, sent by supporters in Birmingham, to assist the reconstruction effort following the storm.</p>\n<p>The <em>Messenger of Peace</em> was not relaunched until May 1832, when two thousand Rarotongans pulled her back to the sea. Returning to Raiatea, Williams was ’perfectly astounded at beholding the scenes of drunkenness which prevailed in my formerly flourishing station’, where many had abandoned the mission during his absence.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> A war against ‘ardent spirits’ was launched, but Williams soon felt the call to return to Samoa.</p>\n<p>Taking flour, horses, donkeys and cattle to missionaries at Rarotonga en route, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> set off for Samoa in October 1832 with Te-ava, a Rarotongan who had volunteered for missionary service. Visiting a number of Samoan islands, Williams heard many had already abandoned their old practices and were awaiting the arrival of missionaries. Commenting on the difficulty of meeting such demand, Williams suggested in his <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises:</em></p>\n<p>I trust that the day is not distant when Missionaries will not be doled out as they now are, but when their numbers will bear a nearer proportion to the wants of the heathen. And why should not this be the case? How many thousands of ships has England sent to foreign countries to spread devastation and death? The money expended in building, equipping and supporting one of these, would be sufficient, with Divine blessing, to convey Christianity, with all its domestic comforts, its civilising effects and spiritual advantages, to hundred and thousands of people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>An appeal for British missionaries for Samoa, where Polynesian evangelists were already at work, became the central focus for the final chapters of Williams’ book. As at other islands in the Pacific, the initial focus for evangelisation was on the overthrow of existing practices, but those in Samoa seemed to be different to the Society and Cook Islands.</p>\n<p>John Williams was told by evangelists about the ‘destruction of <em>Papo</em>… the god of war, and always attached to the canoe of their leader when they went forth to battle’. However, <em>Papo</em> was ‘nothing more than a piece of old rotten matting, about three yards long, and four inches in width’. Although burning was first proposed, new converts agreed that <em>Papo</em> should rather be drowned, since drowning was a less horrific death.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Fauea, who had taken Williams to Samoa, was supposed to tie a stone to <em>Papo</em> before the drowning, but Polynesian teachers intervened, asking that <em>Papo</em> be given to them, so that they could present it to Williams, who according to his book,‘placed it in the Missionary Museum’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Beyond this ‘god of war’, Williams suggested that Samoans ‘generally have no idols to destroy’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The Chiefs were nevertheless persuaded to break their taboos by consuming their <em>etu</em>, the bird, fish or reptile to which they were spiritually bound. Williams suggested that ‘like the ancient Miletans’ they expected to die as a consequence, but when no harm came to them, acknowledged ‘that Jehovah was the true God’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On the way back to Rarotonga, having rescued the wife of Puna, the evangelist to Rurutu (Chapter 12), who had been marooned at Niuatoputapu attempting to return to Ra’iatea, the <em>Messenger of Peace</em> suddenly filled with water. Assisted by Samuel Henry and the crew of the English whaler <em>Elizabeth,</em> who happened to be at Tonga, the source of the leak was discovered – a hole in the keel which had been filled with mud and stones during the hurricane.</p>\n<p>After several months at Rarotonga in early 1833, where Williams continued working on translating the New Testament alongside other missionaries, he returned to Tahiti in July 1833. Meeting a weaver, sent from London by the Directors, Williams delivered him to Rarotonga before returning to Ra’iatea. When a British whaling ship, <em>Sir Andrew Hammond,</em> arrived at the island, ready to make a return journey, Williams, his wife and three children took berths on board, sailing via Cape Horn.</p>\n<p>Arriving in Britain on 11 June 1834, nearly eighteen years after they had left at the age of twenty, John and Mary Williams discovered a metropolis transforming almost as fast as the Pacific islands they had left. One significant change, after nearly four decades of London Missionary Society operations, was the increased number of people in Britain with experience of overseas postings.</p>\n<p>William Ellis had been Foreign Secretary since 1832 (Chapter 13), Martha Mault had been promoting female education since the previous September (Chapter 14), while other former missionaries, such as Henry Townley (Chapter 6), had returned from India to lead British churches.</p>\n<p>When the income of the Society had fallen off rapidly from a peak in 1830, the Directors recognised the potential for missionary speakers to inspire donations. In early 1833, Richard Knill had been invited by William Ellis to return from St Petersburg in Russia to ‘promote the interest of the Society’ , not only among existing auxiliaries:</p>\n<p>but also to organise new societies, wherever practicable, and thus bring under contribution several extensive districts, which are at present yielding very inadequate pecuniary aid towards the great object of evangelising the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>With the abolition of slavery in British colonies approaching in August 1834, Knill’s fundraising had focussed on establishing missions among those who would soon be emancipated. The close links between Missionary work and abolition had been illustrated at the Society’s Annual Meeting in May 1834 which was chaired by Thomas Fowell Buxton, M.P. and leader of the parliamentary anti-slavery lobby.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Three days after John Williams’ arrival in June 1834, around £3000 was raised at an Anniversary meeting of the East Lancashire Auxiliary in Manchester, addressed by Knill.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Williams was soon enlisted to help, addressing the meeting of the Birmingham Auxiliary in September 1834.</p>\n<p>Speaking at Carr’s Lane Chapel, where ‘Pomare’s Idol Gods’ had been exhibited in 1820, shortly after the construction of the chapel, Williams thanked the congregation for the many gifts of ironmongery they had sent him in the Pacific. It was here that John Angell James, prominent Birmingham minister and, like Williams, a former student at Gosport Academy, first asked him to describe the construction of the <em>Messenger of Peace</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams’ descriptions of the Pacific emphasised its spiritual darkness, dwelling on ‘idol-worship’, infanticide and human sacrifice, but blended this rhetorical <em>othering</em> with what Jane Samson has called <em>brothering</em> – a parallel emphasis on a potential for redemption.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In discussing human sacrifice, Williams asked his audience to imagine their distress if their own husbands and fathers had been selected as a victim, declaring:</p>\n<p>And do not for a moment imagine, my dear hearers, that because these wives, and sons and daughters, are of a different colour from yourselves, that they are without natural affection. ‘<em>God hath made of one blood all that dwell upon the earth’.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Alongside speaking at meetings, Williams engaged the Directors in London, persuading them to support the establishment of a theological college at Rarotonga but struggled to get them to take on the expense of a missionary ship. An account of the Tahitian missions, written for the Directors, was printed in the <em>Missionary Magazine</em> in April 1835_,_ where he was introduced in relation to a history of sending ‘idols’ home as indications of conversion:</p>\n<p>By the enterprise and diligence of Mr. Williams in conjunction with his brethren, the gospel has been extended to the numerous islands situated to the west and south of Tahiti, where idolatry has been abolished, whence coffins-full of <em>dead gods</em> have been shipped for England, and where flourishing churches now exist.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams acknowledged many challenges, two decades after the initial conversion of Tahiti, including the widespread use of ‘ardent spirits’, but suggested this was not unexpected since:</p>\n<p>Christianity imposes great restraints upon a people who have been habituated to the unrestrained influence of passion; this was restrained while the excitement of novelty lasted, but as soon as that subsided, these restraints became irksome.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, he asserted that ‘in all the lamentable defections, from Christian doctrine and purity… I have never heard of <em>one</em> individual that has ever thought of returning to the worship of their former gods’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At the Annual Missionary Meeting in May 1835, Williams reported that the British and Foreign Bible Society were printing 5000 copies of the New Testament in Rarotongan, while the Religious Tract Society were producing 10,000 Rarotongan tracts – ‘little messengers of mercy to send on their embassies of love’. He also appealed for ‘ten missionaries to occupy fields already white unto harvest’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Never lacking in ambition, Williams suggested that in addition to the missions started in Samoa, there remained ‘the Fiji Islands… the Hebrides… Solomon’s Archipelago… New Caledonia; New Guinea; New Ireland, &amp;c., with their adjacent islands.’ He made a case for Protestant missionary societies to coordinate their efforts (partly to exclude Catholics), arguing that the rapid expansion of Christianity in the Pacific was ‘unrivalled in the history of Christian enterprise’, ‘excepting Apostolic times’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While the Society’s income for the year after his return reached £53,000, the highest ever, Williams urged supporters to make ‘utmost exertions to raise the funds of the Society from £60,000 to £100,000 during the coming year’. In addition to their usual evangelical middle class circles, he suggested an appeal could be made to the British royalty and nobility, giving them ‘an opportunity of enrolling their names among the friends of the Redeemer and benefactors of the human race’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 5 October 1835, a newly built Mission House was dedicated at Blomfield Street, attended by six new missionary recruits, soon to depart for Samoa.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Part of the reason the new building was necessary was ‘the great increase in the business of the Society which has taken place, during the last few years’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In December 1835, in place of its usual portrait, the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> even included a print showing the ‘Elevation of the New London Missionary House’, built on the corner of Blomfield street and New Broad street at a cost of just over £3000.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Alongside offices, it had a ‘dry and ample warehouse-room, and a Museum’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The Museum, where items presented by John Williams were displayed, was built in surplus land at the back of the building, accessed through double glass doors at the far end of the entrance hall.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>During 1836, John Williams continued to tour the country, addressing meetings of Missionary Auxiliaries (often five or six a week), while working on his book. In more informal settings, Ebenezer Prout remembered him bringing out cases ‘of curiosities which he had brought from the islands’ in order to speak at length about:</p>\n<p>A singular medley of idols, dresses, ornaments, domestic utensils, implements of industry and weapons of war; and not infrequently, Mr Williams arrayed his own portly person in the native tiputa and mat, fixed a spear by his side, and adorned his head with the towering cap of many colours, worn on high days by the chiefs; and, as he marched up and down his parlour, he was as happy as any one of the guests whose cheerful mirth he had thus excited. To this exhibition, he would add explanations of each relic; naming and sometimes describing the island from which he obtained it; the use of the object, or the customs connected with it; and various other interesting particulars.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Such items were sometimes given to guests who displayed a particular interest in them, and there are examples in museum collections such as the Field Museum in Chicago and the Auckland Museum, which seem to have been given to Prout by Williams.</p>\n<p>A portrait of Williams was painted by Reginald Easton, a version of which appeared in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> for May 1836.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Williams also addressed the Society’s Annual Meeting that month, using the history of the Tahiti mission and its past discouragements to provide encouragement in the light of the recent expulsion of missionaries from Madagascar (Chapter 19):</p>\n<p>While the British Christians were praying at home, God was mercifully answering their prayers abroad, for while the vessel was on its voyage to Tahiti, conveying letters of encouragement to the Missionaries, another vessel was on her way to England, bearing not only the glad news of the downfall of idolatry, but also the rejected idols of the people, which were now to be found in the Missionary Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams recounted donations of coconut oil made by Tahitians in support of the Missionary Society, before appealing to ‘philanthropists, merchants, ship-owners, with British seafaring men generally’, as part of his pitch for a missionary ship. The speaker who came after him suggested it was hard to follow someone who ‘could explain “I have discovered a country; I have arranged a language; I have Christianised a people’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Shortly after this meeting, London welcomed further arrivals from the mission field – John Philip, superintendent of the South African missions, accompanied by Jan Tzatzoe chief of the amaNtinde Xhosa lineage, Andries Stoffels, a Khoe church deacon at the Kat River settlement (established in 1819 for dispossessed Khoe in frontier lands), as well as Mr James Read junior, the son of the Rev. James Read senior (one of the early Bethelsdorp missionaries – Chapter 2) and Sara Elizabeth Valentyn, who was Khoe.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The arrival of three African Christians was a spectacle, inviting comparisons to the visit made by their fellow countrymen over three decades earlier (Chapter 2). Travelled expenses were at least partly met by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, the Indian-born evangelical Charles Grant (Lord Glenelg), to enable them to give evidence to the Parliamentary Select Committee on Aboriginal Tribes (British Settlements).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Select Committee had been established by Thomas Fowell Buxton in March 1835, following the abolition of slavery, but arose partly in response to a conflict engulfing South Africa’s Eastern Cape. Its terms of reference appointed it:</p>\n<p>to consider what Measures ought to be adopted with regard to the Native Inhabitants of Countries where British Settlements are made; and to the neighbouring Tribes, in order to secure to them the due observance of Justice and the protection of their Rights; to promote the spread of Civilization among them; and to lead them to the peaceful and voluntary reception of the Christian Religion.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Philip, together with Tzatzoe, Stoffles and Read, addressed the select committee in June – an image of Tzatzoe giving evidence was commissioned from Henry Room, regularly employed as a painter by the Society (Chapter 31). John Willians also addressed the committee in July, and a special missionary meeting was arranged at Exeter Hall for 10 August. An account of the event in the <em>Missionary Magazine</em> described the Africans as ‘savage-born, but new-created men’:</p>\n<p>There were men upon the platform, on whom, although differing from ourselves in colour, every eye was fixed with hallowed and intense delight — men, who came amongst us as harbingers of a brighter day for Africa — earnests of an abundant harvest yet to come, and representatives of thousands of their countrymen who have embraced the truths of Divine revelation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>John Campbell, who had met Tzatzoe on his second journey to South Africa nearly two decades earlier, was keen to remind the meeting of their long connection. Speaking in Dutch, Tzatzoe contrasted long-term conflicts across South Africa with the peace that Christianity promised, deploying his own rhetoric of ‘othering’ and ‘brothering’ to make a distinction between the people in England and the settlers in South Africa:</p>\n<p>Many Englishmen in the colonies are bad, but I will hardly believe that those Englishmen belong to you. You are a different race of men – they are South Africans – they are not Englishmen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Andries Stoffles, also speaking in Dutch, recalled the beginnings of the mission in South Africa, stating:</p>\n<p>I am standing on the bones of your ancestors, and I call upon you, their children, to-day, to come over and help us. Do you know what we want? We want schools and schoolmasters — we want to be like yourselves. You see before you two men of two different nations. You who have put your money into plates, but who never saw the fruits of our labours, I stand here before you as the fruit of your exertions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Read junior, however, reminded the audience of the explicitly political role taken by missionaries in South Africa:</p>\n<p>Your Missionaries have stood betwixt the task-masters and the oppressed, in a country where both the oppressed and the oppressor were degraded almost to the level of the beasts that perish.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>These ‘African brethren’, or ‘African converts’ as they were sometimes known, addressed meetings across the country for several months, frequently speaking on the same platform as John Williams. On 25 October 1836, James Read junior was ordained as a missionary, shortly before he returned to South Africa with Andries Stoffles  on account of their declining health.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tzatzoe and James Read senior, however, remained in Britain another year, during which Tzatzoe’s celebrity continued to grow. His portrait appeared in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> for May 1837, a year after Williams (and following  Stoffles in February).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The following month it was announced that William Cowan had prepared a coloured lithograph portrait of Tzatzoe for sale (one of which survives at the British Museum – 1878,0112.114).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Williams’ book was published in April 1837, he arranged for 50 copies to be sent to members of the nobility, as well as members of the royal family, including the mother of the heir to the throne, who was encouraged to ‘allow your beloved and august daughter to honour the volume with a perusal’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Both Williams and Tzatzoe addressed the Society at Exeter Hall on 10 May 1837, the largest and longest Annual Meeting ever held (at which Charles Mead also spoke – Chapter 14).  Tzatzoe declared:</p>\n<p>If it had not been for the Missionaries there would not now be a Caffre nation; we should have been extinct; the Missionaries saved us. I take this opportunity of thanking the present Government of England… which has given us our rights and returned our country. I shall have very great news to tell my people when I arrive in Africa.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Rev. W. H. Medhurst, who returned from Batavia in August 1836, made a case for the importance of a mission to mainland China, suggesting that a vessel might be launched ’to sail along the coast of China, to be employed not in seeking lucre, but in spreading the blessings of Christianity’ in order to counteract the effects of the opium trade (Chapter 17). <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>Mention of a missionary ship seems to have prompted John Williams to rise from his seat to underline his own case for the Pacific mission.</p>\n<p>Great things had been expected from the Aborigines Select Committee, with John Philip working behind the scenes on the report in collaboration with Anna Gurney (the wheelchair bound cousin of Buxton’s wife, Hannah Gurney) and Sarah-Maria Buxton (Thomas Fowell Buxton’s sister), who worked tirelessly compiling and summarising information from a cottage in Norfolk.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although land taken during the war in South Africa was returned and Governor D’Urban recalled, when it came to the publication of the report in June 1837, in the run up to an election prompted by the death of the King, the more controversial details were excised by Sir George Grey of the Colonial Office. This act of censorship, including the removal of details the humiliating treatment of the body of the Hintza, King of the Gcaleka Xhosa, resulted in a report Anna Gurney described as ‘like a table without a leg’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This appears to have prompted the establishment of the Aborigines Protection Society, which published the original uncensored report in full.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The new society brought together missionaries, abolitionists and humanitarians such as Saxe Bannister, former Attorney-General in New South Wales, who had been an important ally of Lancelot Threlkeld (Chapter 10). The first annual report of the Aborigines Protection Society, declared:</p>\n<p>The abhorred and nefarious slave traffic, which has engaged for so long a period the indefatigable labours of a noble band of British philanthropists for its suppression and annihilation, can scarcely be regarded as less atrocious in its character, or destructive in its consequences, than the system of modern colonization as hitherto pursued.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While the society was ‘anti-colonial’ in opposing the political influence of settlers and traders, it remained ‘imperialist’ in its imagination of a humanitarian and Christian empire, within which ‘others’ would be enabled to become ‘brothers’. Krishnan Kumar has suggested that <em>The Making of</em> <em>English National Identity,</em> with its themes of liberty, prosperity and progress, was marked by a ‘Missionary Nationalism’, a key feature of which he suggests is ‘the attachment of a dominant or core ethnic group to a state entity that conceives itself as dedicated to some large cause or purpose’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>We can arguably see this articulated clearly by the alignment of missionary and imperial agendas at the Aborigines Select Committee. Conflicts from the edges of empire had played out in London through the Select Committee, resulting in an apparent victory, despite the necessary concessions made by Buxton in relation to the report.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It soon became time for the missionaries to return to their stations and on 17 October 1837, the London Missionary Society held a Valedictory Service at Exeter Hall to mark the departures of Charles Mead for India, John Philip for South Africa and John Williams for the Pacific. With thirty-five new missionary recruits, the three veterans headed ‘the largest Missionary Company sent forth by the Society at any one period since the sailing of the ship Duff in 1796’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When John Philip addressed the meeting, he directed its attention to ‘the finest collection of natural curiosities which perhaps was ever seen in this world’, displayed since June at Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, by Dr Andrew Smith, following his return from an expedition to explore the African interior, using LMS mission stations as jumping off points:</p>\n<p>look on the walls of the Egyptian Hall, and you will see pictures, of men feeding like brutes – throwing the spear at each other – engaging in rude dances – having no trace of any thing like education or civilisation. While you gaze, you will find it difficult to persuade yourselves that you are looking at human beings. But on the same walls you will see depicted the Missionary stations; and there you will see people decently clothed; having gentleness in their countenances; exercising the habits of civilised life; exhibiting what Christianity is able to effect for a people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>‘Othering’ and ‘brothering’ could be evoked as a contrast in relation to the developing civic exhibitionary complex, remaining deeply entangled with the missionary enterprise. Philip was followed by Jan Tzatzoe, who seemingly embodied this contrast within his own person, thanking the audience for their support before asking for God’s blessing on them.</p>\n<p>John Williams, when he spoke, expressed a hope that the coming Victorian period would mark a period:</p>\n<p>when the Missionary cause will have such a hold on the public mind that the greatest wealth, the mightiest influence, the most brilliant talents, and the highest rank in the British nation, will be consecrated to it.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams suggested that in contrast to the warfare of preceding periods, Victoria’s reign might diffuse ‘all over the world the knowledge and blessings of that Christianity upon which our own nation’s superiority is based, and in which the present and future felicity of the human family is concentrated’ – a fairly clear statement of ‘Missionary Nationalism’, although one suspects the nation he had in mind was as much British with English, having been born in England to Welsh forbears himself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams was keen to counteract the ‘speculations of philosophers’ and phrenologists who ‘have been describing the colour, the capacities, the weight of the brain’ with the lived experience of missionaries ‘from among all tribes on the earth’, who could stand before the civilised world and say ‘God has made of one blood all nations of men that dwell upon the face of the earth.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Making the case for the special place of the Pacific mission, Williams suggested that there were ‘between 200,000 and 300,000 people wearing and using articles of British manufacture’, while missions had also made many of harbours safe for British maritime shipping. He suggested that the conversion of Tahiti had been the most important turning point in the Society’s history, as well as the beginning of the current enthusiasm for missions, suggesting:</p>\n<p>Every one acquainted with the history of the Missions must know that the Missionary feeling was at a very low ebb till the importation of the rejected idols of Pomare, and from that time to the present the Missionary feeling has been increasing with accelerated progress.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Williams ended his speech by declaring:</p>\n<p>We only want one thing, and that is a ship in which to take the voyage. I am not about to appeal to you – from that I am restricted; but I tell you what I want, and you can give it me. I have made application to her Majesty’s government to be supplied with a ship, and I anticipate the pleasure of carrying England’s commerce, civilisation, and Christianity to distant regions, in a vessel the gift of England’s Queen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Explaining that he was yet to have a definitive answer from the Government, he told the meeting £600 had been promised by supporters, suggesting a thousand friends might give a sovereign each, particularly if advertisements were sent to Liverpool and Birmingham.</p>\n<p>Soon after the meeting, Mead, together with the new recruits sailed for Travancore_,_ and on 25 November Philip, Tzatzoe and Read senior returned to South Africa with a new missionary by the name of Gottleib Schreiner and his wife Rebecca Lyndall (the parents of the novelist Olive Schreiner)<em>.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Only on 18 December 1837 did Williams receive a definitive answer from Sir George Grey, confirming it would not possible for the British State to supply him with a Missionary ship because of the precedent it would establish. By that time, Williams’ <em>Narrative</em> had sold over 4000 copies, more than any previous missionary account.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 27 December an ‘Appeal for the Purchase of a Missionary Ship’ was circulated by the Society, and very quickly returned enough to allow the Camden to be purchased for £1600. When a stranger in Birmingham handed him £100, offering two or three hundred more, Williams stated that ‘It was a delightful illustration of the blessed influence which the Narrative is exerting in the country’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In February, Williams discovered that Captain Robert Morgan, an unusually religious captain whom he knew from the Pacific, had just arrived in London, following a shipwreck on Australia’s north coast. Morgan was quickly recruited to take charge of the <em>Camden</em>, which following its refurbishment was opened to visitors at West India Docks for several days before being towed to Gravesend on 9 April, awaiting its departure.</p>\n<p>On the way down the English Channel, the <em>Camden</em> passed the Isle of Wight, depicted in another colour image image published by John Snow, and on 18 April left Dartmouth, where another valedictory service was held. The <em>Missionary Magazine</em> provided updates on the Camden’s progress for readers, including its meeting  with an American whaler in the Atlantic on 2 June.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The <em>Camden</em> arrived at Cape Town on 1 July, remaining for just over two weeks, enabling Williams to visit the Society’s schools with John Philip.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The next stop was Sydney on 8 September 1838, where the <em>Camden’s</em> arrival prompted the establishment of an Auxiliary Society, as well as the production of another image, showing her leaving Sydney harbour on 25 October 1838.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In January 1840, a letter from Williams was published in the <em>Missionary Magazine</em>, written at Tahiti at the end of March 1839, in which he described the missionaries at Samoa looking meagre and emaciated, while those in the Cook Islands had not been visited in three years, underpinning the ongoing need for a missionary ship_._<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It must have come as a real shock when just four months later, in May 1840, the magazine reported the ‘Mournful Death of the Rev. John Williams’, alongside an extract reprinted from the <em>Bengal Hurkaru</em>, published at Calcutta on 12 February, itself taken from an article in the <em>Australian</em> on 3 December 1839. This reported that after a successful landing at Tanna on 19 November 1839, the Camden had visited the neighbouring island of Erromanga the following day. There both Williams, and ‘Mr Harris’ were clubbed to death on the beach. Unable to retrieve their bodies, Captain Morgan had returned to Sydney.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The <em>Missionary Magazine</em>’s cover in June 1840 unusually did not feature an image. Rather, a thick black line surrounded a a printed letter from Captain Morgan, under a headline announcing the ‘Death of the Rev. John Williams’. Morgan explained that James Harris had been on his way to England to volunteer as a Missionary to the Marquesas.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At Tanna, Williams evidently remarked that ‘he had never been received more kindly by any natives’, leaving three Polynesian evangelists and one of their sons there. At Dillon’s Bay at Erromanga, Williams, Harris, Cunningham (British Vice-Consul a Samoa), together with Captain Morgan and four sailors had approached the shore in a whale-boat. Morgan described the people as ‘a far different race of people to those at Tanna, their complexion darker, and their stature shorter; they were wild in their appearances and extremely shy’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Throwing beads to encourage them to come closer, Williams had given those on the beach fish hooks and a small looking-glass. After a bucket was filled with fresh water, and coconuts given to those in the boat, Harris had been first to wade ashore. Although no women could be seen and the men seemed afraid, Williams followed, giving sections of printed cloth to those on the beach.</p>\n<p>Next went Cunningham, and when it seemed safe, Morgan. Before Morgan had gone a hundred yards, the boat’s crew called him back, and he caught sight Williams and Cunningham running (Harris was the first to be killed). Cunningham reached the boat alongside Morgan, but Williams ran to the sea and stumbled as he reached the water’s edge, when he was struck by the man pursuing him with a club, before another ‘pierced several arrows in his body’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When the boat approached Williams’ body, an arrow was fired into the boat, narrowly missing one of the seamen, followed by a hail of rocks. Returning to the <em>Camden</em>, Captain Morgan ordered a gun to be loaded with power and fired, but the Erromangans dragged Williams’ body out of sight.</p>\n<p>The Editors of the <em>Missionary Magazine</em> were quick to remind their readers that ‘awful and inexplicable as is the dispensation, let the church be still and know that He who has permitted the early fall of his devoted servant is GOD. Though all must mourn, let none complain.’ This account was followed by an appeal to increase the Society’s income to £100,000 during the coming year.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In July, ‘An Appeal on Behalf of the Widow and Family of the late Rev. John Williams’ on behalf of the Directors of the London Missionary Society was announced, while an article appeared in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> under the title of <em>The Martyred Missionary</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By August, the <em>Missionary Magazine</em> announced that Ebenezer Prout was preparing a <em>Life of the Rev. John Williams, Missionary to the South Sea Islands,</em> and it seems that his other old friend, George Baxter, likely began his own project of commemoration at around the same time.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In early May 1841, a year after news of Williams’ death had reached London, newspapers announced the publication of:</p>\n<p>The PAIR of splendid PRINTS, in Oil Colours, representing the deeply-lamented Missionary, THE REV. JOHN WILLIAMS, Landing at Tanna, and the last day of this devoted Missionary’s life at Erromanga.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>They were sold for one pound, five shillings each, and purchasers of the pair were promised a description by J. Leary, one of the survivors of the massacre, as well as ‘an Account of the Islands when visited by Capt. Cook and Capt. Dillon’. According to the accompanying pamphlet, on hearing news of the death of his friend Baxter ‘thought he could not better evince the sincerity of his regret for the loss of his friend than by dedicating his art and labours to perpetuate the memory of so estimable a man’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Unlike <em>The Departure of the Camden, Missionary Ship,</em> which had been published by John Snow, these prints were published by Baxter himself. While <em>The Departure of the Camden</em> was dedicated to the London Missionary Society, Baxter promised a contribution from the profits of these new prints to the ‘fund now being raised for Mrs Williams’, having already given fifty guineas ‘as a kind of ‘first fruits’’, before the prints went on sale.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By comparing Baxter’s published image of Williams’ death on Erromanga to an annotated watercolour sketch, as well as Webber’s 1785 image of the death of Captain Cook, the Australian art historian, Bernard Smith, suggested that Baxter deliberately made the Erromangans darker in complexion and the missionary ‘more heavenly’ in order to ‘suggest the saintliness of Williams and the spiritual depravity of his murderers’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Smith suggested that the ‘remarks’ inscribed on the sketch ‘clearly sought to make the illustration more amenable to evangelical taste’, however it is not clear that they all fulfil this purpose. It is possible that at least some recorded remarks made by someone who had actually witnessed the scene, such as J. Leary, whose eyewitness account was printed to accompany the images.</p>\n<p>Two notes state that the men attacking Williams ‘should be in deeper water’, which may simply be a question of accuracy since an evangelical interpretation of being in deeper water might bring those responsible for Williams’ death closer to baptism. Other notes, selectively quoted by Smith appear to be slightly more ambiguous than he suggests: ‘William I think is more Heavenly in the other sketch, on ?Triate’s Paper he fell forward, not backward’ while another states ‘The Natives. Dark complexion’ and ‘group attacking Harris in the Brooke’.</p>\n<p>In making Baxter’s depiction of Williams’ death at Erromanga representative of missionary presentations of the ‘ignoble savage’,  ‘a squat, swarthy, highly emotional type of being completely lacking in any personal dignity’, Smith ignored the image that was originally published along with it, that of Williams at Tanna.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In this, a barefoot Polynesian teacher in trousers and a shirt stands on a plank linking the dry land to the missionary boat, gesturing towards Williams while looking at a local chief. Williams is shown standing at the front of the boat ‘with his hat in hand, waiting for permission to land’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> When the two prints are placed alongside each other, although the scenes on the beaches are very different, the outline of the coast and the mountains in the background suggests a considerable degree of lateral symmetry.</p>\n<p>In fact, the two prints were created to be displayed alongside each other, and the scene at Tanna suggests an alternative possibility for Erromanga. Baxter himself referred to the relationship between the two images as a ‘melancholy contrast’, with the same boat, ‘natives’ and Missionary, ‘but alas! In how changed a position’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Part of the visual symmetry that links Baxter’s images relates to the sky behind Williams. This is suffused with bright light, suggestive of missionary rhetoric which regarded overseas mission as a means of shedding light into darkness.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By including cloth, mirrors and boxes of provisions in the boat at Tanna, Baxter connected this ‘enlightenment’ project to the charitable gifts made by British supporters of the mission, just as he included them in his <em>Departure of the Camden, Missionary Ship</em>. Missionary work overseas was depicted as a charitable gift.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>If the scene at Tanna depicts the welcoming acceptance of this gift, the ‘massacre’ at Erromanga illustrates the opposite: a gift violently rejected. In his essay on <em>The Gift</em>, Marcel Mauss suggested that while those involved in gift exchanges are in theory ‘free agents’, in practice they have an obligation to give as well as to receive: ‘To refuse to give….just as to refuse to accept, is tantamount to declaring war; it is to reject the bond of alliance and commonality’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Erromangans’ refusal to receive the charitable advances of Williams dehumanised them in comparison to their neighbours at Tanna, and this difference is visualised by Baxter’s depiction of their physical appearance. According to Baxter’s description of the scene at Erromanga ‘every countenance [is] expressive of the most diabolical malice and rage…they all seem intent on the work of death’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> His use of the word ‘diabolical’ suggests that Baxter may have regarded the Erromangans as motivated by satanic forces, just as his contemporary Mead saw evidence for the work of the devil in South Indian religious practices (Chapter 14).</p>\n<p>It would be easy to exclusively concentrate, like Bernard Smith, on Missionary forms of ‘othering’, since the description and depiction of gruesome pre-Christian practices such as human sacrifice formed an important part of missionary rhetoric, deployed in fundraising campaigns such as those of John Williams, as well as in Missionary publications. To do so without recognising their mirror image – the ‘brothering’ described by Jane Samson, premised on a project of redemption and reform – would be to fail to acknowledge the full picture – the light alongside the shadow – and would arguably simply position missionaries themselves as ignoble ‘others’.</p>\n<p>Given regular Missionary insistences that all humans were ‘of one blood’, words taken from the English Bible (Acts 17:26) where they form part of St. Paul’s speech to the Athenians, as a motto by the Aborigines Protection Society, we can begin to recognise Missionary ‘othering’ as not primarily racial, but rather essentially spiritual. Spiritual depravity marked the absence of a connection to God, a condtion to which Europeans, including South African and Australia settlers, could be as vulnerable as non-Europeans.</p>\n<p>Baxter’s depiction of the chief at Tanna with an elaborately wrapped loin cloth and a white feather in his headdress, carrying a finely worked club that is more a sceptre than an offensive weapon, is suggestive of his peaceful intentions, but it was presumably also intended to suggest his openness to the possibility of salvation. Without such openness, marked by an acceptance of what Mauss called ‘the bond of alliance and commonality’, evangelical mission, even when underpinned by the practical resources offered by a missionary ship such as the <em>Camden,</em> remained an impossible project.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>Missionary ships have long been something of a fascination, seemingly capturing evangelical enthusiasms in artefactual form. I was lucky enough to be awarded a Caird Research Fellowship  at the National Maritime Museum to pursue the topic in 2015.</p>\n<p>Gréine Jordan began her collaborative doctoral research with the National Maritime Museum in 2018, which she has recently successfully completed. Central to her thesis was the parallel between the John Williams missionary ships and the Juvenile Missionary Magazine, both launched in 1844. This chapter is intended to supply the prehistory for that complex.</p>\n<p>I am very grateful for the ongoing guidance and maritime input of Robert Blyth, Senior Curator of World and Maritme History at the National Maritime Museum, as well as John McAleer, who reminded me to always italicise ship names while writing this chapter! John was kind enough to give this chapter a close reading and I am extremely grateful to him for spotting the various typos which had infiltrated the text…</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div><section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>(1838) Departure of the Missionary Ship Camden for the South Seas, <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle for May 1838,</em> p.247: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5PUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical%20magazine%20and%20missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=RA1-PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5PUDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical magazine and missionary chronicle&amp;pg=RA1-PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> ; Rev.

Unwelcome visitors, they were nevertheless greeted ‘with great civility’, told the Admiral was on shore, and offered tea.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In his account of these events, published the following year, Jocelyn noted that it was ‘not such as ladies in England would approve of, for the Chinese always drink it so weak that the water is barely tinged, and the leaves of the plant form a necessary part of the nauseous mixture’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The English had clearly already developed their own ideas about tea drinking!</p>\n<p>After half an hour, Admiral Zhang Chaofa returned to his ship, where Gützlaff presented him with a written summons in Chinese, informing him of their intention to occupy the island. He was invited to surrender to avoid any bloodshed and given an hour for his answer.</p>\n<p>Before the hour was up a number of senior Chinese officials transferred to the <em>Wellesley</em>, declining Fletcher and Jocelyn’s offer to remain behind as hostages. On the <em>Wellesley</em> they met Commodore James Bremer, Commander-in-Chief, who reiterated his orders. Accepting an offer of sweet wine, the Chinese officials complained at being made responsible for the actions of their colleagues at Canton (who had destroyed stocks of opium a year earlier), informing the Commodore that they would nevertheless do their duty in defending the island.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Harry Darell, aide-de-camp to Brigadier-General George Burrell who was commander of the landing troops, sketched the meeting, wine glasses and a decanter on the table in front of the Chinese delegation. Two years later, his sketch became the basis for an acquaint print. At its centre is Gützlaff, the only man wearing no obvious signs of rank.</p>\n<p>How did a missionary come to occupy such a central role in an invasion which, during the twentieth century, came to be regarded as the beginning of China’s ‘century of humiliation’? How did a catalogue of the Missionary Museum, printed around 1860, come to include an ‘Idol taken in the late war, from the chief temple at Chusan’?</p>\n<p>Back home, the East India Company was under pressure from British manufacturers, who felt the Company was content with its profits from the trade in tea alone. The <em>Lord Amherst,</em> therefore, took two hundred bales of British goods to see if they would sell. Gützlaff also took a selection of tracts, as well as copies of Morrison’s Bible translation, distributing these wherever the <em>Lord Amhert</em> stopped while offering medical treatment.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>To answer at least the first of these questions, we have to return to Robert Morrison, the original LMS missionary in China. He had found his foothold as a translator for the East India Company at Canton (Guangzhou), attempting to serve two masters. The promise of mainland China, with its unconverted population of hundreds of millions, was central to Morrison’s appeals for missionary recruits during the time he spent in Britain between March 1824 and May 1826 (Chapter 9).</p>\n<p>A number of those who studied Chinese in London with Morrison subsequently volunteered. One of these, Maria Newell, became the Society’s first unmarried ‘Lady Missionary’, leaving England in April 1827. Another, Mary Ann Aldersey, followed in August 1837.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Someone else who met Morrison in London was Karl Gützlaff, at the time preparing for missionary service with the Rotterdam based <em>Nederlandsch Zendeling Genootschap</em> [Netherlands Missionary Society]. Born in the Prussian Province of Pomerania, Gützlaff received his initial missionary education at Johannes Jänicke’s Mission Institute in Berlin, under the patronage of the Prussian King.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Gützlaff sailed for Jakarta in September 1826, where he spent four months learning Chinese with Walter Medhurst, sent by the LMS as a missionary printer a decade earlier. Gützlaff then went to the Dutch controlled island of Bintan, near Singapore, to work with its Chinese population. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By August 1827, however, he felt called to the mainland, with its significantly larger population. In June 1828, Gützlaff was preparing to visit Siam (Thailand) and Cochin China (Vietnam), with the LMS missionaries Walter Medhurst and Jacob Tomlin, another of Morrison’s students in London. They planned to distribute bibles and medicine, but when Medhurst was late to arrive, Gützlaff and Tomlin went ahead without him.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1829, Gützlaff went to assist the Anglo-Chinese College at Malacca, marrying Maria Newell, who returned to Bangkok with him. Despite numerous bouts of ill health, Gützlaff made plans to travel to China. In February 1831, however, Maria died in childbirth, along with one of their twins.</p>\n<p>Severing his links with the Dutch Missionary Society, a despondent Gützlaff made arrangements for the care of his surviving daughter, who died soon afterwards, and sought passage on a Chinese trading ship.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In December 1831, Gützlaff arrived at Macao, having travelled the length of China’s coast with a group of Chinese sailors he later described as ‘from the most debased class of people’:</p>\n<p>The major part of them are opium-smokers, gamblers, thieves, and fornicators. They will indulge in the drug till all their wages are squandered; they will gamble as long as a farthing remains; they will pull off their only jacket and give it to a prostitute… A person who has lived among these men, would be best qualified to give a description of Sodom and Gomorrah, as well as to appreciate the blessings of Christianity…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Gützlaff’s immersion in Chinese language and customs gave him a fluency and perspective unparalleled among other Europeans. He was not, however, particularly suited to working with them. Robert Morrison, with whom Gützlaff stayed in Macao, wrote to the LMS treasurer in London, that:</p>\n<p>He would not work well, I fear, with others. Secondly, he would be insubordinate and, at first, domineering. He is unaccustomed to the yoke of social intercourse, but seems since he came to improve.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By February 1832, Gützlaff had been employed as translator and physician on an East India Company vessel, the <em>Lord Amherst</em>. This was to sail as far as Korea “to ascertain how far the northern ports of this Empire may gradually be opened to British commerce’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Captain Lindsay’s report on the <em>Lord Amherst’s</em> journey, together with a supplementary section by Gützlaff, was published in London in 1833. Seemingly anticipating the subsequent invasion, details were given of Chinese harbours and rivers, reporting that their defences were often in disrepair and the soldiers poorly trained and equipped.</p>\n<p>At Zhoushan they noted that the ‘extensive fort’ on a high hill was ‘dismantled and ungarrisoned’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The report even suggested that the common people might be induced to ‘shake off the Tartar yoke’, the ruling Qing dynasty being of Northeastern Manchu, rather than Han origin.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Concerned Chinese official communications described the <em>Lord Amherst</em> as creeping ‘like a rat’ along the coast.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While British manufactures only traded for comparatively low prices, opium was established to be highly valued all along the coast. Although the <em>Lord Amherst’s</em> attempts to engage in illegal trade were resisted, some local officials indicated they would turn a blind eye to opium trading in exchange for a bribe.</p>\n<p>By October 1832, Gützlaff had been hired as an interpreter and guide for the <em>Sylph</em>, an armed clipper that was built in India for the Parsi merchant Rustomji Cowasji Banaji. The <em>Sylph</em> had recently arrived from Calcutta with a cargo of opium and was chartered by the traders William Jardine and James Matheson to seek out new trading locations along the Chinese coast.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Gützlaff’s account of this third voyage, published in London in 1834 as the final part of his <em>Journal of Three Voyages Along the Coast of China</em>, notes that he joined the <em>Sylph</em> only _‘_After much consultation with others, and a conflict in my own mind’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> His account of the voyage, in an uncharacteristically diplomatic manner, makes no mention of the opium that was sold from the vessel, which as translator he presumably negotiated prices for.</p>\n<p>Gützlaff does state, however, that he took and distributed three times the number of religious books on this trip as he had on his earlier voyages, providing ‘an opportunity of scattering the light of divine truth’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The Sylph returned to Lintin Island (Nei Lingding Island), the centre for opium trading near Macau, on 19 April 1833.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In December 1833, on renewal of its Royal Charter, the East India Company lost its monopoly and therefore control of British trade with China, rendering opium trading essentially unregulated and, as a result, extremely competitive. Gützlaff continued to be employed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Company, who were determined to dominate the trade, making at least four more voyages between 1833 and 1835.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>One of these journeys had the additional purpose of obtaining tea seeds and plants, as well as information about their cultivation and processing. There was concern that Britain’s substantial market for tea, worth £4 million a year to the East India Company and the source of 7% of Britain’s public revenue in excise duties, created a dependency on a potentially unstable supply at Canton.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Attempts to reduce the unidirectional transfer of European silver to China had resulted in a triangular trade, in which opium grown in India was illegally traded to China by ‘country traders’ such as Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. The narcotics trade between India and China remained officially independent of the East India Company, who nevertheless used the resulting silver to purchase Chinese tea. This model was obviously disrupted when the East India Company was converted into what became an essentially administrative body, responsible principally for the government of India.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The establishment of Indian tea plantations offered a way for the Company to short-circuit the Chinese trade. George J. Gordon was sent by the East India Company’s Tea Committee to China from India in June 1834, where he engaged Jardine Matheson &amp; Co to assist him.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>  He secretly travelled into the hills of Fujian with Gützlaff as translator, seeking tea seeds, plants and cultivators to send to India. Most of the seedlings ultimately died, and tea production in Assam proceeded using local plants but neverthrless drew on the technical knowledge of Chinese workers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Following the end of East India Company’s monopoly in China, Robert Morrison’s services as translator were transferred to Lord Napier, the newly appointed Chief Superintendent of Trade for the British Government. Arriving at Canton in late July 1834 without an official permit, Napier attempted to establish direct diplomatic relations with Chinese officials, in which Britain, having established global naval dominance alongside a substantial Asian empire, sought to be treated as an equal.</p>\n<p>Napier had Robert Morrison direct a letter directly to Lu Kun, Governor-General of Liangguang, rather than going through the Canton Hong merchants as the East India Company had customarily done.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Lu Kun refused to accept private letters from an ‘outside barbarian’, creating a diplomatic impasse. Robert Morrison died on 1 August 1834, within a week of Napier’s arrival, and was replaced as official translator by his twenty-year-old son, John Robert Morrison.</p>\n<p>In August 1834, in the midst of growing frustration, Lord Napier wrote to London suggesting, for the first time, that the British might take possession of Hong Kong island to establish a trading entrepôt. When Lu Kun halted British and American trade, ordering Chinese staff to leave the factories, Napier ordered two British frigates and a cutter to approach Canton, exchanging fire with Chinese forces at Whampoa.</p>\n<p>British and Indian merchants ultimately pressurised Napier, who was seriously ill, to back down. He was only allowed to travel to Macao for medical treatment when the British frigates departed, dying there on 11 October 1834.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In December, Gützlaff was recruited as a second Chinese interpreter by John Francis Davis, Napier’s replacement as British Superintendent of Trade. Davis was the son of an East India Company director and had worked at Canton as a young man, accompanying Lord Amherst’s embassy to Peking in 1816 with Robert Morrison (Chapter 9). Peaceful trading relations resumed at Canton, at least for a time.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1835, James Matheson (of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co) traveled to London along with Napier’s widow in an attempt to drum up support for a war against China. Ultimately dismissed by the Duke of Wellington, Britain’s Foreign Secretary at the time, Matheson nevertheless raised the profile of China among British statesmen, not least through the publication of his book <em>The Present Position of Prospects of the British Trade with China</em>, a free-trade tract demanding ‘the full countenance and support of the British government’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In September 1835, as a mark of Gützlaff’s growing celebrity in Europe, the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> announced the publication of a print for sale, showing him ‘in the dress of a Fokien Sailor’. This was based on a painting made by George Chinnery at Canton, which had recently been exhibited at the Royal Academy in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the illegal opium trade continued expanding rapidly and in May 1835 Gützlaff, despite his official government position, accompanied Gordon on another illicit journey to obtain tea plants. They were fired upon by Chinese troops in the hills northwest of Fuzhou, a bullet narrowly missing Gützlaff’s head.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> As a result of rising tensions and the expanding opium trade, Chinese coastal defences were reinforced and Chinese opium traders prosecuted. Chinese Christians were also targeted, with Liang Fa (an early convert of Robert Morrison’s), escaping to (British-controlled) Singapore.</p>\n<p>At the end of August 1835, Walter Medhurst and Edwin Stevens, an American Congregationalist chaplain to the sailors at Whampoa, embarked on their own missionary voyage along the Chinese coast, chartering the <em>Huron</em> from David Olyphant. Olyphant was an American trader who refused to deal in opium and was a member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Indeed, Olyphant had named his own son Robert Morrison Olyphant in tribute to his friendship with the LMS missionary he first met at Canton in 1820.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Writing to the LMS directors on 1 November 1835, Medhurst rather pointedly described his voyage as ‘the first instance of a decidedly Missionary ship going up the coast’ to distribute scriptures and tracts. While they had been able to land and walk about, Medhurst thought it would prove ‘entirely out of the question for a Missionary to attempt taking up his residence in any part of China, except Canton, or to penetrate far into the interior by roads or rivers’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In August 1836, Walter Medhurst returned to London, after eighteen years serving with the Ultra Ganges Mission. Medhurst made a number of appeals in the evangelical press. Inspired by the contemporary success of John Williams’ <em>Missionary Enterprises</em> (Chapter 15), he also wrote a book of his own.</p>\n<p><em>China; Its State and Prospects, with Especial Reference to the Spread of the Gospel</em> was published in May 1838, following a template established by Williams’ book. Its illustrations were even produced by George Baxter, including a colour frontispiece.</p>\n<p>This showed Medhurst, together with Choo Ti Lang, a Confucian scholar from Guangdong province who accompanied Medhurst to England to assist with Bible translations, attended by a Malay boy.</p>\n<p>Summarising the British reaction to Gützlaff’s accounts of his voyages, Medhurst suggested that:</p>\n<p>There were not a few, also, who insinuated that his lively imagination, and confident expectation, had led him to give too high a colouring to things; while his zeal had prompted him to state what he wished or contemplated, rather than what he actually experienced.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Medhurst presented his own voyage as intended to ‘set this question at rest’ as well as ’to ascertain the openings which existed, for the propagation of the Gospel, in that empire’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He made it very clear he felt that ‘All wise and good men, also, consider the cause of God contaminated’ by a connections with opium vessels:</p>\n<p>But the most serious objection is, that the Chinese bring it as the main argument against Christianity, that its professors vend opium; with how much greater force would they urge this objection, should a missionary embark in an opium ship, and carry out boxes of tracts in company with chests of opium?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Medhurst was clear that ‘the evils connected with the disposal of opium’ on such a voyage ‘were likely to be greater, more extensive, and more durable, than the good that might be accomplished by the distribution of books’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Such objections betray a fairly obvious criticism of the approach taken by Gützlaff, though how apparent this would have been to all contemporary readers is unclear.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Choo Tih Lang was baptised at Hackney on 20 July 1838, having recently joined the crowds to see the coronation of Queen Victoria.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> At the end of that month, just over three months after the departure of the Camden (Chapter 15), he sailed from Gravesend with Medhurst and his family, as well as William Lockhart, recently appointed as a  medical missionary to China.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The first of the Society’s medical missionaries, Archibald Ramsay, had established a Medical Mission at Neyyoor in Travancore (Chapter 14), only months earlier.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In September 1838, most likely with the assistance of the London agents for Jardine Matheson &amp; Co, Gützlaff published his own two-volume book, <em>China Opened.</em> This opened with an advertisement declaring:</p>\n<p>China is now happily open to our commerce; China will soon be open to our more general intercourse: and China will eventually be open to Missionary enterprise. It is therefore a favourable and indicative circumstance, that it is being opened to our understanding by a variety of useful publications.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Gützlaff seems to have regarded missionary and trading interests as essentially aligned in their efforts to ‘open’ China, whereas Medhurst was rather more cautious about entangling evangelical efforts with those of opium dealers. This difference between the two men seems to have marked an emerging division with Britain’s evangelical communities.</p>\n<p>The embrace of Christianity by the early Victorian British state enabled empire and evangelicalism to become increasingly entangled and elided. Some argued that an expanding empire of free trade opened a door for the entry of Christianity, while others preferred the missionary movement to maintain its independent moral high ground.</p>\n<p>The situation in China began to shift decisively in early 1839, when Lin Zexu, recently appointed Imperial Commissioner, made his way from Beijing to Canton. William Jardine, regarded as leader of the opium traders, hearing that he was in the new Commissioner’s sights, left Canton for Macao, before departing for London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Commissioner Lin made it clear to the Chinese population of Canton that he expected them to assist in suppressing the opium trade once and for all. He even composed a letter to Queen Victoria, asking for assistance in preventing the export of opium from India. Within two months, Lin had arrested over 1600 people and seized 43,000 pipes as part his war on opium.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In March, Lin ordered that all stocks of opium in the Canton warehouses be surrendered. When Dent and Company, Jardine Matheson’s principal rival, failed to hand over all their chests, Lin summoned Launcelot Dent.</p>\n<p>As the situation escalated, Lin blockaded the factories at Canton, and on 27 March 1839. Charles Elliott, British Plenipotentiary at the time, instructed British merchants to surrender their stocks, telling them that they would be compensated. Over 20,000 chests of opium were handed over and publicly destroyed by Lin Zexu.</p>\n<p>News of these events began arriving in London during late summer, and on 27 September 1839, Jardine met with Palmerston, Britain’s Foreign Secretary, demanding a forceful response. Jardine provided detailed maps, a plan for the invasion (including the invasion of Chusan), as well as his desired outcome – the opening of additional Chinese ports to British trade. Three days later, the cabinet agreed to embark on Britain’s first war with China.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It took time to raise a fleet from across the Empire, but twenty-four ships from England, the Cape, India, and New South Wales sailed from Singapore to Macao at the end of May 1840. What they didn’t have, however, was anyone who could speak Chinese.</p>\n<p>John Robert Morrison and Charles Gützlaff were seconded to the fleet as translators, along with Robert Thom, an employee of Jardine Matheson &amp; Company. With the entrance to Pearl River and Canton blockaded, a number of ships sailed north to Chusan. On the 3<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> of July, the <em>Atalanta</em> made its way into the harbour to establish a route.</p>\n<p>The Chinese delegation left the Wellesley at around 8pm on 4 July 1840, but sounds of activity and the sight of lanterns moving about on the shore lasted all night. Chinese trading ships were allowed to sail between the British ships ‘laden half way up their masts with good and merchandise, and crowded with women and children… although in their cargoes many a captain might have made their fortune’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>According to official despatches, sent by Commodore Bremer, by morning Chinese commanders:</p>\n<p>had placed a body of troops on the the Temple hill, together with three guns in position, twenty-one guns were in line on the different wharfs, and on a round tower of solid masonry they had five guns. The war junks were hauled on shore in line, with their rudders unhung, and presented thirty-four guns, and forty-five large gingals.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>High tide at noon allowed the remaining men-of-war (<em>Cruiser</em> and <em>Algerine,</em> 18 guns each_),_ as well as a number of transport ships to enter the harbour. By half-past two, with landing troops waiting in boats, the Wellesley fired a single shot at the round masonry tower. This was answered by the Chinese guns and responded to by a cannonade lasting around eight minutes, the British ships having between them over 200 guns.</p>\n<p>When the smoke cleared, the shoreline had been cleared of people and the landing force arrived on the beach where ‘bodies, bows and arrows, broken spears and guns’ were ‘the sole occupants of the field’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The Eighteenth Royal Irish Regiment took possession of the temple on the hill, but the city walls of Tinghai were not breached until the following morning.</p>\n<p>Entering the largely abandoned town with Gützlaff, Jocelyn found placards on houses reading ‘Spare our lives’. They also saw men, women and children on their knees in the temples, burning incense. Making their way to the ‘Chumpin’ or Admiral’s house, they found ‘silks, fans, china, little shoes, crutches, and paint-pots’ in the ‘apartments of the ladies’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In his published account, Jocelyn recorded that ‘many of these fairy shoes were appropriated by us as lawful <em>loot’.</em> A footnote in the published account explains that ‘loot’ is ‘A Bengalee word for plunder, at which, by-the-bye, they are peculiar adepts’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Miniature women’s shoes were by no means the only things plundered, however. An article in the Indian Gazette declared that after troops were landed ‘a more complete pillage could not be conceived than then took place’:</p>\n<p>Every house was indiscriminately broken open; every drawer and box ransacked; the streets strewed with fragments of furniture, pictures, chairs, tables, grain of all sorts, &amp;c; and the whole set off by the dead, or living bodies of the inhabitants, who had been unable to leave their city from the wounds received from our merciless guns….</p>\n<p>It went on:</p>\n<p>The plunder was carried to an extreme — that is to say, did not cease till there was nothing left to take; and the plunderers will no doubt be able, on our return to Calcutta, to place at their friends’ disposal, and for the ornamenting of their houses, trophies gained, not from Chinese soldiers or from a field of battle, but from the harmless and peaceable inhabitants and tradesmen of a city doomed to destruction by our men-of-war; who, a few days previous, issued a very strict order to all the transports to use forbearance towards all the natives in our dealings with them, as we did not war with the people, but required reparation at the hands of the Chinese Government.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This passage was to be reprinted many times, particularly by those who argued that the ‘opium war’, with its use of what came to be known as ‘gunboat diplomacy’, had placed a moral stain on the British nation.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Many evangelicals continued to campaign against the opium trade, with the Missionary Museum displaying opium pipes, as well a series of:</p>\n<p>Six etchings by a Chinese artist named Sunqua, exhibiting the Progress of the Opium Smoker from health and prosperity, to misery and degradation, and forming together a counterpart to Hogarth’s famous set of the ‘Rake’s Progress’.

Micaiah Hill of Berhampore.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>These seem to have painted in early 1837, a detailed description appearing in April of that year in <em>The Chinese Repository</em>, a periodical published by American Protestant missionaries at Canton.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Nevertheless, the anti-opium stance of the London Missionary Museum did not prevent it openly acknowledging that at least one of the items displayed in the case alongside Sunqua’s paintings was the result of looting at Zhoushan.</p>\n<p>While many of the soldiers were indeed Indian, the East India Company’s army being larger than that of the British state at the time, Jocelyn’s comments about ‘lawful loot’ make it clear that plunder was seen as legitimate and fairly normal, even by those at the top of the British military establishment. A ‘prize’ system was instituted at Chusan, two officers appointed as commissioners ‘to collect and take care of all public property’.</p>\n<p>Although disappointed to find no bullion in the public treasury, they nevertheless organised a sale to dispose of property including ‘some very handsome dresses’. Shares in the proceeds were distributed according to rank, with ‘a captain’s share of prize-money’ being expected to amount to twenty reals. One particularly ‘beautiful war dress’ was reserved to be sent to Victoria, the British queen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As part of his description of the aftermath of the invasion, Jocelyn described seeing temple figures ‘surpassed by none in China’:</p>\n<p>In the great temple, some of the figures in the principal hall are upwards of fifteen feet high, handsomely wrought, standing in the centre on a lofty pedestal, while around the walls are small images of the same description in all sorts of grotesque attitudes. We were particularly struck by one, the figure of a woman, with a child apparently issuing from her breast, and a glory round her head. It seems difficult to say from what this has arisen, unless for pictures of the Virgin, which the Chinese formerly obtained from the Jesuit missionaries, and have this distorted.</p>\n<p>Did the ‘Idol taken in the late war, from the chief temple at Chusan’ at the Missionary Museum form part of the military spoils of the invasion on 5 July 1840? Was it sent to the museum by missionary supporters in India, like ‘Burmese Idols’ had been following the invasion of Rangoon in 1824? Did it from part of an allocation of spoils to John Robert Morrison or Charles Gützlaff, in their role as interpreters? Or was it purchased by them at the auction organised by the prize agents after the battle?</p>\n<p>I haven’t been able to establish any conclusive evidence to show how this item found its way to London and the collection of the Missionary Museum, or even to identify the ‘idol’ in question. The close connections between with the London Missionary Society and several people involved in the invasion of Zhoushan, chiefly Karl Gützlaff and John Robert Morrison, creates a field of possibilities, some more likely than others.</p>\n<p>In addition, the LMS was quick to take advantage of the British capture of Zhoushan. William Lockhart worked briefly at the missionary hospital in Macao following his arrival in early 1839, but left for Batavia that August because of the developing conflict. At the end of August 1840, Lockhart, together with a number of other new missionary recruits, wrote to the Directors from Macao, expressing a hope that the ‘home government’ might suppress the opium trade, and suggesting a new Mission should be established in the Chusan Archipelago, by then under British control.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The following month Lockhart sailed to Chusan to establish a missionary hospital, where, by the 14<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> December he had treated 1600 people, many of them sickly soldiers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Gützlaff’s second wife sailed for Dinghai in October, to join her husband, who had been appointed Chief Magistrate. At the end of February 1841, Lockhart left Zhoushan after the British returned the island to Chinese hands, in exchange for the cession of Hong Kong and an indemnity of $6 million.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The agreement, however, was rejected by both the Chinese Emperor and the British Government, so Chusan was invaded once again on 1 October 1841. The British conflict with China ultimately concluded at Nanjing in August 1842. There, once again, Gützlaff and Morrison played important parts in translating the treaty. This opened five Chinese ports to British trade (Canton or Guangzhou, Amoy or Xiamen, Fuchow or Fuzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai) and committed the Chinese government to an increased indemnity of $21 million.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In an image commemorating the signing of the treaty aboard the <em>HMS Cornwallis,</em> Gützlaff is once again shown near the centre, standing behind the table where the Chinese delegates are seated. His position is mirrored by John Robert Morrison although the translator sitting at the table was not a missionary, but Robert Thom, Jardine Matheson &amp; Company’s translator.</p>\n<p>Following the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing, Gütlaff returned to Zhoushan as Chief Magistrate, but when John Robert Morrison died in August 1843, he became Chinese secretary to the British government at Hong Kong. Zhoushan was eventually restored to China in July 1846 after the indemnity had been paid.</p>\n<p>By that time, many felt that the island would have been a better long-term British possession than Hong Kong.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The LMS, however, had already moved on to the Chinese mainland. In late 1843, a new mission was established to Central China by Walter Medhurst, with the establishment of a mission at Shanghai, with William Lockhart serving as a medical missionary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When conflict with China once again tipped into military confrontation a decade and a half later, Zhoushan was occupied for a third time, on 21 April 1860. On that occasion, the published narrative of Garnet Wolseley noted that:</p>\n<p>The gods and various paraphernalia of idolatry were removed from the temples to places of security by the priests and other parties interested in their preservation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In late 1843, with news of the conflict in China still fresh in Europe, a twenty-five year old Karl Marx sat down to write the introduction for <em>A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s</em> <em>Philosophy of Right.</em> Summarising the position developed by Ludwig Feuerbach in his 1841 book <em>Das Wesen des Christentums</em> (translated as <em>The Essence of Christianity</em> by George Eliot in 1854), he wrote that ‘the foundation of irreligious criticism is: <em>Man makes religion</em>, religion does not make man’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He then famously suggested:</p>\n<p><em>Religious</em> suffering is, at one and the same time, the <em>expression</em> of real suffering and a <em>protest</em> against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the <em>opium</em> of the people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Marx argued that religion should be abolished so that the illusory happiness of the people could be converted into a demand for real happiness, resulting from the abolition of conditions of life that need such illusions.</p>\n<p>While much of the rest of his essay concerned itself with the political condition of contemporary Germany, it is striking to reflect on the ways in which the historical conjunction between opium and Christianity in China may have contributed to the formation of a phrase that came to define Marxian attitudes to religion, with significant historical consequences, not least in China itself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div><section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Jocelyn, Lord (1841). <em>Six Months with the Chinese Exhibition; or, Leaves from a Soldier’s Note-Book</em>, London: John Murray, p. 48: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsQGRQgIcP8C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Robert%20Jocelyn%20six%20months&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsQGRQgIcP8C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Robert Jocelyn six months&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Jocelyn, Lord (1841). <em>Six Months with the Chinese Exhibition; or, Leaves from a Soldier’s Note-Book</em>, London: John Murray, p. 48: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsQGRQgIcP8C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Robert%20Jocelyn%20six%20months&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsQGRQgIcP8C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Robert Jocelyn six months&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>(1840). ‘China – Asiatic Intelligence, Supplement <em>The Asiatic Journal</em>, December 1840, pp.345-354: <em>pp.</em> <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ug0oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA346#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ug0oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA346#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Jocelyn, Lord (1841). <em>Six Months with the Chinese Exhibition; or, Leaves from a Soldier’s Note-Book</em>, London: John Murray, pp. 49-50: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsQGRQgIcP8C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Robert%20Jocelyn%20six%20months&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsQGRQgIcP8C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Robert Jocelyn six months&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Jocelyn, Lord (1841). <em>Six Months with the Chinese Exhibition; or, Leaves from a Soldier’s Note-Book</em>, London: John Murray, p. 50: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsQGRQgIcP8C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Robert%20Jocelyn%20six%20months&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsQGRQgIcP8C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Robert Jocelyn six months&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn6\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Jocelyn, Lord (1841). <em>Six Months with the Chinese Exhibition; or, Leaves from a Soldier’s Note-Book</em>, London: John Murray, p. 53: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsQGRQgIcP8C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Robert%20Jocelyn%20six%20months&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tsQGRQgIcP8C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=Robert Jocelyn six months&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref6\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn7\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>McKelvey, L.

In high demand as a speaker, in June 1842 Moffat published his book, <em>Missionary Labours and Scenes in Southern Africa,</em> closely following the model established by John Williams’ (1833) <em>Narrative of Missionary Enterprises in the South Sea Islands.</em> The illustrations were even produced by George Baxter.</p>\n<p>During the service, Rev. Thomas Binney told Moffat :</p>\n<p>We feel deeply the circumstance of similarity between you and the late lamented “Martyr of Erromanga;” you and Williams sat together at your ordination; and I suppose you were together when you took leave of the brethren. Very similar were your labours, duties, and achievements, among a people in somewhat similar circumstances. Both returned to England — both went in and out among the churches — both had every where an honourable welcome — both greatly interested the world as well as the church — and both gave us a record and image of themselves in a printed book — and now you are departing as he departed — may God grant that here the parallel may end; that you may be taken to the land of your adoption; that you may there live for many years in labour yet more abundant, and with results still more remarkable!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Weeks later, George Baxter announced the sale of a pair of coloured oil portraits for 10s. 6d. each, one showing Moffat with a ‘Bechuana parliament”, the other showing Williams ‘seated in his Study composing his celebrated Missionary Enterprises, which have been designated as a Supplement to the Acts of the Apostles’. Baxter even created a logo for the prints, showing two sides of a globe and the areas of the world in which each missionary worked.</p>\n<p>Rev. John Campbell had compiled <em>The Missionary’s Farewell</em> to document the events of Williams’ departure in 1838, and also published <em>The Farewell Services of Robert Moffat</em> in 1843.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> While the former included a black and white engraving of <em>the Camden</em>, the latter featured a signed portrait of Moffat, perhaps indicating an increasing salience of missionary portraits (and signatures). Missionaries like Moffat were on their way to becoming celebrated heroes, presumably partly a consequence of the high profile death of John Williams.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of Campbell’s account of the meeting, he provided a description of the Mission House, ‘That our distant, and especially our juvenile readers may more fully enter into the spirit of a valedictory service at the Board of the London Missionary Society’. Entering the hallway from Blomfield Street, a ‘double glass door’ at its far end ‘admits you to the Missionary Museum, an awful yet glorious place!’. Campbell told his readers:</p>\n<p>There is not such another, connected with Protestant missions, in England, in Europe, or in the world. The numerous idols and articles of heathenism which you behold, were supplied chiefly by the missionaries of the London Missionary Society; a few other interesting objects are donations from benevolent travellers, or friendly officers of mercantile vessels.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>He then described cases A-C, holding ‘upwards of <em>three hundred</em> gods and objects of superstitious regard, from the islands in the Pacific Ocean’, before turning to the ‘gigantic idol… brought from Rarotonga, by Mr Williams’ nearby, although this was outside the case. Campbell lingered on the arrow fired into the boat of the Camden, ‘brought from Erromanga by a sailor who witnessed the murder of the devoted and honoured missionary!’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Case D was said to contain ’considerably upwards of <em>two hundred</em> idols and articles from China and Ultra-Ganges’, but the description focused on ’six etchings, by a Chinese artist named Sunqua, which tell a sad tale concerning the results of the cupidity of some of our wicked countrymen — the PROGRESS OF THE OPIUM SMOKER’ (Chapter 16).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Case F displayed idols and objects of superstition from India, including the three Presidencies’, dwelling on ‘Kalee, the black goddess of cruelty’ alongside her consort ‘Shiva, <em>the destroyer</em>’, noting that the history of this god could be taken as ‘a chronicle of the basest, foulest deeds of which fallen humanity can form a conception’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Compared to such lurid descriptions, the paragraph describing case G, showing ‘articles of dress, domestic utensils, arms, and other curiosities from Africa and Madagascar’, is rather mild. Items described included a medicinal stick and ivory armlets ‘given by the queen of Lattakoo [Dithakong] to the late John Campbell’, as well as ‘neck, arm, and leg rings, used by the Mantatee females’ and ‘presented by Mr Moffat’ (Chapter 8).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Finally, the text described a series of Natural History specimens including a boa constrictor killed at Kristnapore near Calcutta which had featured on the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> for July 1836 (Chapter 14), the giraffe ‘shot in Griqua country… by Mr Campbell’s party, July 31, 1814’ (Chapter 3), as well as:</p>\n<p>Two large crocodiles… killed in the Lempopo [Limpopo] river, in the interior of South Africa, and presented by Mr. Moffat. But I must desist, and refer you to the catalogue, which you may have of the messenger, and which will explain every article in the museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sadly, no catalogues from this date survive, but an image of the museum was published in the <em>Illustrated London News</em> a few months later, on 20 May 1843, to illustrate an article describing the Society’s Annual Meeting. Readers were told:</p>\n<p>The museum of this admirable society has latterly become an indispensable appendage to the great anniversary meeting. It is very rich in the natural history of the Polynesian Islands; and its Tahitian collection, rivals, in extent and usefulness, the collections of Captain Cook at The British Museum. Thither, after their meetings, the friends of mission are wont to repair, to revive their sympathies by an actual inspection of those idol gods which it is the first aim of the society “utterly to abolish”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The image, described as ‘a perspective view of the principal room’, has the giraffe as its focus (Chapter 3), rivalled in height by the ancestral pole from Rarotonga (Chapter 12). One of the crocodiles can also be made out lurking below a number of missionary portraits, next to what appears to be a globe. In front of the giraffe, a small glass case on a stand encloses a miniature thatched house.</p>\n<p>The description which provides this chapter’s title comes from a later catalogue, printed around 1860. It appears to be an updated version of a much shorter listing, ‘MODEL of a HOUSE at Lattakoo’, which appeared in the 1826 catalogue. It seems likely that this model was sent to the museum in late 1823, along with items associated with the battle of Dithakong (discussed in Chapter 8).</p>\n<p>Bizarrely, an image described as a ‘New Zealand Hunt and Fence of Garden’ appeared in <em>The New Zealanders,</em> published in 1830, alongside images of a number of a number of other items from the Missionary Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In April 1839, following the relocation of the museum in 1835, the collector and curator Henry Syer Cuming wrote to the Directors about ‘the miserable state of the Missionary Museum… not only of utter confusion and Chaos, but in a state of ruin and decay’. He suggested items in the collection were:</p>\n<p>fast going to decay, the damp walls have generated mould… the Moth had committed its ravages… leaving hairless skins to mask its progress… the spider has spun its web in every corner, and the extraordinary works both of God and Man are alike obscured, and disfigured with dust and cobwebs.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>e demanded, ‘Is it so much to ask, that those Idols to which the Heathen once paid divine honours, be preserved in England as a monument of the glorious triumphs of the Cross, achieved by the Christian armies of our Country’. Cuming volunteered his services towards ‘identifying localities’, presumably necessary if a South African house could be mistaken for one from New Zealand.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is unclear whether Cuming’s offer to undertake the ‘Augean task of arranging the Missionary Museum’ was taken up, but it seems to have at least prompted some action. Someone directed to the museum by the former LMS missionary Lancelot Threlkeld in Australia (Chapter 10), who was pleased to find Threlkeld’s portrait still on display, published an account of a visit to the museum soon afterwards, in January 1840. He suggested that ‘although the arrangement of the numerous specimens is at present very imperfect, and no catalogue has been published, we obtained every necessary information from the labels affixed to the different articles, and from the intelligence and attention of the curator’, quite possibly Cuming himself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Cuming’s engagement with the museum is suggestive of the growing interest in what, to use a newly coined term, was called ‘Ethnology’. The Ethnological Society of London was established in February 1843 as a distinct, more scientifically oriented, group by members of the Aborigines’ Protection Society. In the same year, the Quaker physician, James Cowles Prichard, published his <em>Natural History of Man</em> (which included a named portrait of Jan Tzatzoe in his military jacket, see Chapter 15). This reached a conclusion that humans were all essentially of one type, despite external physical differences.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When the description of the museum featured in the account of Moffat’s Valedictory service in 1843, a catalogue was once again available. This suggests the description of the model house may actually have been updated while Moffat was in Britain, between June 1839 and January 1843.</p>\n<p>As a young and relatively unknown missionary, Moffat had remained unnamed in the 1826 catalogue. By the 1860 edition, however, he was recorded as the donor of nineteen items. Some were likely donated in 1839, but others were already at the museum by 1826.</p>\n<p>As well as the addition of Moffat’s name to multiple catalogue descriptions, another notable change was the inclusion of a number of Setswana words in later catalogue descriptions (just as Australian words were used for a small number of items in the 1826 catalogue – see chapter 10). These included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Litlaka</em>, or sandals made of hide, four pairs, worn by the Bechuana tribe.</li>\n<li><em>Makantsa</em>, a Bechuana sash, suspended on the hip, in their dances.</li>\n<li><em>Manyena</em>. Ear-drops of brass wire. Bechuana.</li>\n<li><em>Mihitsana</em>. Finger-rings, of ditto.[Brass wire] From ditto.[Bechuana]</li>\n<li><em>Matlatla</em>. Bechuana earplates of copper, worn only by persons of distinction.- Presented by the Rev. R. Moffat</li>\n<li><em>Likhau</em>, large angular plates of copper, worn across the breast by Mantatee warriors.</li>\n<li><em>Litola</em>, or sticks, for producing fire by friction. Bechuana.</li>\n<li><em>Limao</em>, or needles and cases, used by the Bechuanas, Barolongs, and Mantatees.</li>\n<li><em>Lekuka</em>, a vessel of ox-hide for preparing milk.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Part of Moffat’s reason for returning to Britain was to oversee the printing of a Setswana translation of the New Testament. Working on this presumably improved his linguistic abilities, but it is also the case that John Mokotedi Serian, who accompanied Moffat, could easily have supplied these words. Mokotedi’s visit to Britain provides an important glimpse into the increasingly limited roles African Christians were allowed to play within the emerging church.</p>\n<p>As part of his work on <em>African Teachers on the Colonial Frontier</em>, the historian Stephen C. Volz has pieced together the details of Mokotedi’s life. Mokotedi, he tells us, was a child when he took refuge at Moffat’s mission with his mother, Moshane, as part of the group of defeated ‘Mantatees’ (Chapter 8). She was subsequently joined by her husband, Nteledi, a leader of the Bakwena ba Monaheng (a branch of the people of the crocodile), but was not permitted to receive baptism until Nteledi separated from her in 1833 (as his second wife, she was party to a polygamous marriage).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although his parents returned South to pursue an allegiance with the powerful emerging leader of the Basotho, Moshoeshoe (also a member of the Bakwena, the people of the crocodile), Mokotedi returned to the mission to complete his education, as well as to receive medical treatment. There, Robert Moffat seems to have established a relationship of patronage with Mokotedi, lending him four cattle.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This sort of relationship is termed <em>mafisa</em> in Setswana, enabling poorer members of a community to gain access to cattle in return for looking after them, using their milk and keeping some of the offspring. It is, however, a relationship that involves an expectation of loyalty. Mokotedi also seems to have assisted Moffat with the work of translation, as well as working as a typesetter at the mission printing press.</p>\n<p>In southern Africa, Mokotedi had been dependent on Moffat. Arriving in Britain, he was celebrated as an African Christian and the given the same treatment as other visitors such as Mary, John and Martha in 1804 (Chapter 2), but also more recently Jan Tzatzoe, Andries Stoffels, and James Read junior (Chapter 15). According to Moffat:</p>\n<p>He was taken to platforms &amp; schools to give addresses and to be admired. He was invited to jaunts, picnics &amp; evening parties. He was taken by the arm &amp; led into dazzling drawing rooms, became the toy of the young ladies; &amp; some old ones too, he was politely asked the favour of locks from his hair &amp; mementoes from his pen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At a Juvenile Missionary Meeting at Exeter Hall in March 1840, Moffat introduced Mokotedi, telling the assembled children of his rescue from the field of battle with his mother, when ‘bloody battle axes” had been thrown at Moffat’s head. He also introduced Sarah Roby, a young African girl, buried alive as a baby but rescued and adopted by the Moffats. She had been named after the wife of Moffat’s mentor in Manchester, William Roby, and served the Moffats as a maid. In England, she was ‘learning the infant school system, with a view to instructing her countrywomen’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When William Wallace Scott painted Moffat in 1842, Mokotedi and Sarah Roby were shown at his feet. Mokotedi’s face appears only inches from a copy of the Setswana New Testament, open in Moffat’s hand. The book, together with Moffat’s face, hands, and white shirt are bright points of light in an otherwise rather gloomy painting, presumably intended to show Moffat a bringing light into Africa’s ‘heathen darkness’.</p>\n<p>Mokotedi’s posture, in particular, echoes the beseeching attitude taken by an enslaved African in the famous icon of the slavery abolition movement, who asked ‘Am I not a man and a brother?’ Such images served to connect the anti-slavery movement with a wave of missionary work in Africa. Less than a year after the final emancipation of slaves across the British Empire, on 1 August 1838, Thomas Fowell Buxton established the <em>Society for the Extinction of Slavery and for the Civilization of Africa,</em> on 1 June 1840 at Exeter Hall. The following year, this sent a major expedition of three Royal Navy steamers up the Niger River in West Africa, with the aim of promoting legitimate commerce alongside Christianity to replace the slave trade.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This turn to Africa, after the abolition of slavery, also seems to have impacted a young medical missionary initially inspired by Karl Gützlaff’s call for missionaries to China (Chapter 16). Following a series of meetings with Robert Moffat in London, David Livingstone sailed for southern Africa in November 1840. He would become the most enduringly famous British missionary of the nineteenth century, and certainly the only one to be granted a British state funeral after his death in Africa in 1873 (see Chapter 21).</p>\n<p>Robert Moffat played an important role in shifting missionary attitudes towards Africa and Africans. Unlike Johannes Van Der Kemp and James Read who took African wives, and, according to their critics, even adopted African dress, Moffat carefully cultivated his distance.</p>\n<p>When it had been proposed that Robert Moffat replace James Read as head of the LMS mission at Dithakong in 1820, Robert Hamilton, another resident missionary, noted that Kgosi Mothibi pointed out that “all were not alike, that Mr. Read, I and John Hendrick did not beat the children when they came and plagued us.” Moffat had only worked in the region for two years, but his reputation already preceded him.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Following his appointment, Moffat dismissed a number of African Christians from their formal (and salaried) roles at the mission, including Cupido Kakkerlak, a stalwart of the church at Bethelsdorp who had been Campbell’s ‘travelling director’ in 1813 (Chapter 3). Using influence gained at the Battle of Dithakong, Moffat set about moving the mission to Seoding, closer to Kuruman’s natural spring after he returned from the Cape in 1824.</p>\n<p>Moffat seems to have been anxious to escape his own dependence on Kgosi Mothibi. Instead, he began establishing his own clients, such as Mokotedi, and the new location of his mission increasingly became a refuge for displaced people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Moffat even seems to have self-consciously asserted a status as Mothibi’s equal, wearing a jacket and waistcoat made from leopard skin, a material normally reserved for Tswana royals.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In January 1825, Andrew Smith, a military doctor recently appointed Superintendent of the South African Museum in Cape Town, wrote to Moffat asking him to collect for the new museum. He expressed a particular interest in snakes, frogs, as well as ‘an animal near Latakoo somewhat like an armadillo covered with scales’, presumably the pangolin. Smith also sent Moffat arsenical soap along with a set of printed instructions describing how to preserve their skins.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>What Moffat actually sent to Cape Town is unclear, although a knife with an ivory handle carved in the form a zebra at the South African Museum in Cape Town (now Iziko 3306) is associated with an old label with Moffat’s name on it. When Smith led the <em>Expedition for Exploring Central Africa</em> beyond the boundary of the Cape Colony in 1834, it was to mission stations, including Kuruman, that he initially went. In a report, published following his return to Cape Town, Smith wrote:</p>\n<p>The importance of the services which were rendered by the various Missionaries we visited, will, ere this, have been apparent; yet, comparatively speaking, but a small proportion of their real utility has been noticed, from the necessity of abstaining, on the present occasion, from particular details. To all of them I consider the Association to be deeply indebted for whatever degree of success has attended the exertions of the expedition and to Mr Moffat especially, for the friendly reception and the kind treatment which we experienced from Umsiligas [Mzilikazi]<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Moffat’s establishment of a personal fiefdom at Kuruman in the decade before Smith’s arrival had been associated with a significant building programme. While the model house at the Missionary Museum in London represented a typical building at Maruping [New Dithakong or Lattakoo] in the early 1820s, when Smith’s expedition arrived at Kuruman in 1835 they found a row of stone buildings. One member of the expedition even described the mission as ‘the most perfect station’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The earliest church on the site, which doubled as a schoolroom, was built by Joseph Arend, who had escaped slavery at the Cape to trade in ivory beyond the frontier, eventually purchasing his freedom with the profits. He was a skilled builder and thatcher, and seems to have been baptised when the building, initially a rectangular 51 by 16 feet, opened in May 1829.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>After two stone houses had been built to house the missionaries, the foundations of a larger chapel, double the size of the original at 100 by 30 feet, were laid out between them. Labour and donations were promised to aid its construction by a number of local supporters – at the time there were over 200 houses in the vicinity of the mission, housing around 800 people, around a quarter of whom regularly attended Sunday services.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Construction of the new chapel was overseen by Mr Millen, a stonemason who pursued a sideline as an ivory trader. Building work was supported by additional funds raised at the Cape, supplemented with donations sent by Mary Moffat’s brother, a missionary at Madras in India, as well as from Rev. Richard Knill at St. Petersburg in Russia.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> After Millen died on a trading expedition in 1834, the stone walls were completed by David Hume, a trader resident at the mission.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The other LMS missionaries at Kuruman, Hamilton and Edwards, prepared wooden doors and windows for the chapel, but found it impossible to find trees that were large enough to make beams for the roof. In 1835, Moffat accompanied Smith’s expedition to the capital of Mzilikazi, leader of the Ndebele who had conquered large areas of what would become known as the Transvaal. He sought and was given permission to harvest suitable timber, taken to Kuruman in two large wagons.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In March 1840, less than a year after Moffat’s return to Britain, the cover of the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> featured a ‘View of the Kuruman Mission Station in South Africa’. This was based on an image painted by Charles Davidson Bell, an artist who accompanied Smith’s expedition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The same image would later feature in Moffat’s 1842 book as ‘A Bird’s Eye View of the Kuruman’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the foreground are the well-tended mission gardens, surrounded by hedges, facing a row of rectangular buildings including the chapel (its roof must have been imagined by Bell since it had not been completed when he visited). The description, printed in 1840, explains:</p>\n<p>The Mission Church occupies the centre — the buildings on either side the Church are the dwelling house of the Missionaries — the conical buildings in the rear, the huts of the natives; and the mountain in the distance marks the locality of the outstation, Hamhana.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In striking contrast to the Mission Museum, where the conical Tswana house occupied a prominent central place, such houses are only a background feature of this image, located at the rear and referred to in the caption as ‘the huts of the natives’. Such derogatory and dismissive terms had not always been so readily used.</p>\n<p>When William Burchell published an account of his visit to Dithakong in July 1812, he provided a section and plan of ‘Bachapin house’, composed, like Moffat’s model, of a series of concentric circles. Each dwelling was, according to Burchell between 40 and 60 feet in diameter, enclosed by an outer fence or wall that was between four and a half and seven feet tall, providing protection from enemies, wild animals and strong winds.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The fence could be crossed at a single gap in the front, narrower at the bottom, with the top only wide enough for a pair of shoulders to pass. The enclosed space was divided between a front-court and back-yard, both with a floor made from clay tempered with cattle dung that was ‘beaten or spread exactly level, and perfectly smooth’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Moffat’s model only includes a fence at the front, although the location of the back fence was marked with paper.</p>\n<p>While the design of the house varied ‘according to the wants and inclinations of its owner’, Burchell suggested that he hadn’t seen a single building with straight lines or a right angle, suggesting:</p>\n<p>it seems therefore, that their own observation and experience, has taught these people by practical demonstration, the axiom that a circle comprises a greater area than any other figure of equal circumference… this, the making of the outer fence, or the walls, is performed with as little labor as possible.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The roofs of the larger houses covered a space of around 26 feet in diameter, extending beyond the walls to create a veranda-style space that was shaded from the sun and rain. As well as providing a sleeping place, the house was also used for storing:</p>\n<p>clothing and arms, for which, darkness is convenient as it conceals the property from the knowledge of their neighbours or of strangers. The only opening therefore, is the <em>doorway</em>; which may be better described as, a hole in the wall just large enough to admit a person to creep through, and of the shape of an irregular oval, the larger end of which being upwards, and the smaller a foot above the floor.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is not easy to make out from photographs, but when I shone a light into the interior of Moffat’s model house at the British Museum, I could see that the entrance was indeed an irregular oval. Burchell praised the ‘neatness, good order and cleanness’ of the dwellings he saw, particularly evident in the ‘better houses’, suggesting:</p>\n<p>If we consider the habits and customs of this nation, their mode of life, and the state of society among them, we must acknowledge that such dwellings as have now been described are exceedingly convenient and perfectly suited to every want and fitted to every circumstance<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>One key feature of such houses was that they could be built from locally available materials whenever the <em>motse</em> or village was relocated, a not infrequent occurrence. However, they needed constant renewal, in particular through re-thatching and re-plastering the walls and floor after seasonal thunderstorms.</p>\n<p>While some houses had no further interval divisions, Burchell’s plan includes an <em>inner apartment</em>:</p>\n<p>frequently built in the shape of a cone, or of a half-ellipsis, the point of which reaches up to the height of the roof, which serves to support and strengthen. In other instances, as in the Plate, its form is cylindrical; and this appeared to be an improved construction.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>According to Stephen Kay, a Methodist missionary who visited the large settlement of Kaditshwene in August 1821, this apartment was ‘the hidden shrine of the Bootchuana Penates, this sanctum in which the more important domestic vessels and property of the inmates are preserved; and during the winter months it is employed as a sleeping apartment by the family’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The anthropologist Jean Comaroff has suggested that the Setswana word for house, <em>ntlo</em>, establishes a metaphoric connection with the uterine interior of the female body, suggesting that the house was ‘the site of delicate transformative processes associated with procreation and nurture’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Kay’s description of the inner apartment as ‘the hidden shrine of the Bootchuana <em>penates’</em> (a Latin term used to describe Roman household gods, including representations of important ancestors) suggests that this inner space was an important locus of ancestral power.</p>\n<p>Houses of the type depicted by Moffat’s model, built largely built by women, provided family groups with their own enclosing body, with space at their centre for venerated ancestors, made present at least partly through the presence of ancestral possessions. In the Setswana Bible, Moffat ended up translating ‘God’ as <em>Modimo</em>, which the historian Paul Landau has suggested may have simply referred to an ultimate ‘ancestor’ in earlier times.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While ancestors and their spirits were also a feature of ceremonial life in Polynesia (Chapters 12 &amp; 13), there does not seem to have been any obvious southern African equivalent to the carved representations of spirits which became a focus for missionary invective against ‘idols’, hence their absence in the missionary museum. One does have to wonder, however, how conscious Moffat was that people venerated particular animals when he gave the skin and bones of two crocodiles to the Missionary Museum.</p>\n<p>Indeed, John Mokotedi Serian was one of the ‘people of the crocodile’ (Bakwena) for whom the killing and eating of crocodiles was certainly forbidden, so how comfortable he would have felt travelling travelling to Britain with the remains of two of these creatures can only be imagined.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Moffat seems to have recognised an important difference between southern African ceremonial practices and those in other mission fields, telling a revealing story at the farewell service held for him in Edinburgh. A Tswana man, he said, came into his house, sat down and leafed through a copy of <em>Missionary Sketches.</em></p>\n<p>Familiar with the portraits on display in Moffat’s house, as well as the ‘figures of game, and horses and men’ drawn by women on the ‘walls of their houses’, on encountering missionary images of ‘idols’ he asked Moffat’s little girl ‘What game is this?”</p>\n<p>When told him they showed carvings worshipped by other nations, he accused her of fibbing and sought out Moffat for confirmation. When he confirmed that the people who made such objects of veneration from wood and stone had the same capacities as himself — heads, lungs, and the capacity to speak — he replied ‘After this, never say that the Bechuanas are either foolish or ignorant”. Taking out his own whistle, carved from ivory, he asked:</p>\n<p>What would my people think if I were to worship that?… They would think I was a madman, and would throw me over a precipice, and cover me with stones.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Moffat asserted that this proved the absence of idolatry in southern Africa, although the manner in which the man thought he would be killed suggests he may have believed he would ultimately have been accused of witchcraft if he behaved in this way.</p>\n<p>Moffat went on to tell his audience that the Botswana ‘can reason, and reason well; that they can express themselves in language that would vie with the or more civilised nations’, giving the example of ‘one of their public parliaments’ where you will see:</p>\n<p>the profoundest order, while orator after orator, or senator – call them if you please – after senator, rises and describes the state of the nation, the different movements that are to be attended to, or plans that are to be devised or exertions made, in order to save the state or save the town. I have heard them cutting hairs, I should almost say.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While clear about the intellectual capacities of individual Africans, as well as the decorum of their political institutions, Moffat seems felt that their lives nevertheless needed to be reoriented around a Christian God. The large stone chapel at Kuruman arguably reflects this attitude in material form. Rather than being hidden at centre of domestic space, Modimo, the ultimate ancestor, was provided with a prominent and permanent space at the centre of his new community.</p>\n<p>When Moffat first proposed establishing his mission at Seoding, Mothibi had objected that there not enough trees from which to build houses. While Moffat partly solved this problem by building the mission buildings from stone, and locating roof beams elsewhere, the mission’s location likely limited the scale of the houses which could be easily built by the Africans who made their homes there. The establishment of a permanent stone-built church at Kuruman coincided with a reduction in scale of the houses built by African Christian for themselves, and, over time the removal of sacred space from their centre.</p>\n<p>Given that Moffat kept copies of <em>Missionary Sketches</em> at his home, he likely followed reports of conversions in Polynesia, where the efforts of his ‘missionary brother’, John Williams, were generally crowned by the communal building of substantial new places of worship, as at Rarotonga (Chapter 12). Indeed, the 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum described the display of the  ‘Household Idols of Pomare’ in front of:</p>\n<p>A large model Church, 712 feet long, built for Pomare, for the worship of Jehovah.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Such Polynesian edifices, frequently built at the site of a former <em>marae</em> (ceremonial enclosures), were largely initiated and overseen by Polynesian leaders. The stone chapel at Kuruman, however, seems to have been overwhelmingly built by Europeans, with Africans only providing unskilled labour (excepting the earlier chapel built by Jan Arendt).</p>\n<p>The article about the chapel, printed in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> in 1840, underlined that it had largely been a European effort, suggesting that:</p>\n<p>The raising of the roof was found to be an herculean and dangerous task, in a country where there were neither blocks nor tackles, and but few individuals who dared to trust themselves on naked walls. While the roof was proceeding, the natives often remarked that the Missionaries must have been brought up in a baboon’s country, and therefore accustomed to precipices and walls.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Chapel finally opened in November 1838, shortly before Moffat and his family returned to Britain. The final paragraph of the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> article pointed out that a shortfall of just under £100 remained on the chapel, presumably hoping the article would stimulate further donations to clear this.</p>\n<p>The model house at the Missionary Museum in London, built by Moffat at Maruping, and the stone church, built under his watch at Kuruman, appear, at first sight to be inversions of one another — a small-scale African building made from clay and wood as against a large-scale European style building, made from stone. Both are, however, interesting hybrids. The model sits on pieces of flat planed wood, presumably taken from a wooden box, made in Europe or the Cape. The stone chapel relies on two key African building technologies for its ongoing maintenance, thatching using local grasses and the plastering of its packed earth and dung floor.</p>\n<p>While credit was given to Moffat in the catalogue for building the model, and to Millen, Hume, Hamilton and Edwards in missionary publications for their contributions to building the chapel, its maintenance always depended on African labour. Missionary texts sometimes make a careful distinction between the chapel, as a building, and the Church, composed of a body of baptised worshipping members. In this case at least, the chapel appears to reflect the kind of Church Moffat was attempting to build at Kuruman – one overwhelming directed by Europeans.</p>\n<p>According to Burchell, the back-yard of the house of a Kgosi generally had ‘a small hut for their immediate <em>servant</em> or attendant’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> It is surely significant that the surviving missionary houses at the Kuruman mission also have such small huts in their back yards. In climbing from his lowly origins as a cabin boy and apprentice gardener to a status equivalent to a Tswana Kgosi, Moffat evidently expected to find willing servants among African Christians.</p>\n<p>In producing a coloured image to appear opposite the title page of Moffat’s book, George Baxter used another painting made by Charles Davidson Bell of the Kuruman Mission. This shows the chapel at its centre, bathed in light, flanked on its left by Moffat’s house. There are a number of Africans in the background of the image, one pushing a wheelbarrow, another carrying a rake. Two women on the right of the image appear to be carrying firewood on their heads, presumably gathered in the surrounding area to supply the mission.</p>\n<p>In the foreground of the scene, Baxter superimposed the commanding figures of Robert Moffat and Robert Hamilton, both White and Male. Moffat appears to be pointing to a book, presumably the recently printed New Testament translation. John Mokotedi Serian is nowhere to be seen.</p>\n<p>When Moffat replied to Rev. Binney’s address during the evening meeting on 23 January 1843, he made a number of remarks about ‘native agency’:</p>\n<p>I have, it is true, not all the confidence that some, less experienced, have in certain kinds of native agency. Native agency may very properly be compared to a body of sepoys, who will fight well while they have good English officers to lead them on.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>How did John Mokotedi Serian, sitting near to Moffat, feel when he heard his patron assert a subaltern status for himself and his people within the missionary enterprise? A week later, they boarded a steamer together at London Bridge, transferring to the <em>Fortitude</em> at Gravesend, which took them to the Cape.</p>\n<p>On board the ship, Mokotedi was upset at not being allowed to eat at the Captain’s table and evidently refused to do ‘an iota of service’ for the Moffat family, complaining that Moffat had not properly acknowledged his role in their translation work. According to a letter, subsequently written by Moffat to the Directors:</p>\n<p>The officers of the ship took John in his black sabbath clothes, stuck him into a flower [flour] bag just emptied, &amp; sent him on deck to shew the company they they could make him what he so earnestly coveted to be, a white man.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mokotedi was expelled from the Church on his return to Africa, although he evidently continued to regard himself as a Christian. Nearly a decade later, in May 1854, he wrote to Rev. Dr. Charles Orpen following a series of meetings with African leaders, about a school being planned for their children at Cape Town:</p>\n<p>And they have asket many times this quistion. They say. How is it that the Missionary has been so long a time in this country upworts to more than 50 yeas, and yet we have no Minesters no School Masters, made out of our own country men? We do not onderstant this; that we must be taught only by the white men, and we the blacks will never be able to do it ourselfs. The white men is making a <em>fools</em> of us. They are teaching us only for to oby them and for there on conviniances. If so be that we shall awes be tought and never be able to learn, never come to be like the Englishmen it is then of no use to learn at all.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The original missionary dream of universal Christian brotherhood was increasingly undermined by such questions of race. What Catherine Hall has called ‘Fault-lines in the Family of Man’ would only become more active and dangerous as white settlers increasingly followed missionaries into the interior of the African continent.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>Volz, S.C. 2011. <em>African Teachers on the Colonial Frontier.</em> New York: Peter Lang, p. 111.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XEX3h7mDz2IC&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=The%20New%20Zealanders&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XEX3h7mDz2IC&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=The New Zealanders&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></p>\n<p>Volz, S.C. 2011. <em>African Teachers on the Colonial Frontier.</em> New York: Peter Lang, pp. 72-74: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ilJiAAAAcAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=departure%20of%20moffat%20missionary%20service%20campbell&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ilJiAAAAcAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=departure of moffat missionary service campbell&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></p>\n<p>Volz, S.C. 2011. <em>African Teachers on the Colonial Frontier.</em> New York: Peter Lang, p. 75: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ilJiAAAAcAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=departure%20of%20moffat%20missionary%20service%20campbell&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ilJiAAAAcAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=departure of moffat missionary service campbell&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></p>\n<p>Volz, S.C. 2011. <em>African Teachers on the Colonial Frontier.</em> New York: Peter Lang, pp. 148-149: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ilJiAAAAcAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=departure%20of%20moffat%20missionary%20service%20campbell&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ilJiAAAAcAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=departure of moffat missionary service campbell&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></p>\n</div><section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>_1843. ‘_The Opium Trade in China’, Missionary Magazine and Chronicle for March 1843, p. 150: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HMrSQR8cXs0C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical%20magazine%20and%20missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HMrSQR8cXs0C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=evangelical magazine and missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>William Ellis resigned the post of Foreign Secretary due to ill health in 1841.

He had arrived in Demerara as a missionary in 1828, but his official connection with the Society ended a decade later in somewhat acrimonious circumstances. Still, enough time had probably now passed to build some bridges, and what better way than by offering a gift.</p>\n<p>Ketley began his letter by describing a recent visit to the ‘Animal and Bird preserver of this city’, where he had been:</p>\n<p>much taken with a beautiful perfect specimen of an Alligator as in the Agonies of Death under the pressure of a large Camoanic Snake (Boa Constrictor) – the Serpent having coiled itself around the body of an Alligator from neck to tail; thus rendering it at first powerless, and then lifeless.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>He immediately thought of the London Missionary Society’s Museum, hoping it still had room for the specimen — it came in a box that was 3ft 9in long, 2ft wide and 1ft 10in high. If the Directors agreed, ‘the Deacons of the Church will be united in the presentation and deposit, in token of our attachment to the Society’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>For Ketley, as a Congregationalist, each Church formed a self-governing sovereign entity, ministered by a pastor who was accountable to the congregation, assisted by deacons, but was ultimately responsible to God. The governing principles of Independent Churches built on New Testament descriptions of the earliest Christian Churches, were formed in the cauldron of the European Reformation, and played a decisive role in the English Civil Wars of the 1640s.</p>\n<p>When combined with the increasingly global operations of an officially non-denominational missionary society, modelled on a joint-stock company and overseen by a Board of Directors, these principles faced some challenges. Nevertheless, the London Missionary Society continued to restate a ‘Fundamental Principle’ that had been adopted in May 1796 each year in its Annual Report:</p>\n<p>that its design is not to send Presbyterianism, Independency, Episcopacy, or any other form of Church order and government, (about which there may be difference of opinions among serious persons), but the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, to the heathen; and that it shall be left (as it ought to be left) to the minds of the persons whom God may call into the fellowship of his Son from among them, to assume for themselves such form of Church government as to them shall appear most agreeable to the Word of God.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>[^Presumably designed to keep the largest possible number of the people happy, this formulation left open the question of when the question of church government would be determined, and by whom. When did a Mission became a Church in its own right? How could one tell it was ready to operate independently? How closely did an infant Church need to adhere to its parent Society?]</p>\n<p>Such questions came sharply into focus in the decade that slavery was abolished across the British Empire, which also saw the London Missionary Society’s achieve the venerable age of fifty. Its jubilee was celebrated in 1845, a term which came from the Old Testament book of Leviticus, where God commanded Moses in Mount Sinai that after ‘seven times seven years’, slaves and prisoners should be set free, debts forgiven, and land returned to its original holders. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While missionary work on the African continent offered one way to continue the enthusiasms of Britain’s Anti-Slavery movement (Chapter 17), her Caribbean colonies also became a focus for missionary attention as they prepared for the end of slavery, a latter-day ‘day of atonement’.</p>\n<p>Ketley would have been aware of the Natural History specimens displayed at the Missionary Museum since it opened in 1815, including its towering giraffe (Chapter 2). I can’t help feeling, however, that this particular example of taxidermy made him think of the London Missionary Society for other reasons too. Was he not, at some level, reminded of his own long struggle with the Directors to establish Providence New Chapel as an Independent church?</p>\n<p>Can we regard the young Alligator as like his congregation, struggling to break free from the snake-like coils of the London Missionary Society? Like the protectiveness of an overbearing parent, did its embrace feel like something which needed to be escaped for a truly independent future to commence?</p>\n<p>Following John Smith’s death in prison following the Demerara uprising of 1823 (Chapter 5), there had an attempt to exclude missionaries from the colony and seize their Chapels for the established Church of England. Ultimately however, the Governor was recalled to London and Joseph Ketley arrived as a twenty-six year old missionary recruit in December 1828, sent to continue the Society’s work at Providence Chapel in George Town.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ketley’s first decade would see a further rebellion in Jamaica in 1831, sometimes called the Baptist war because of the central role played by Black Jamaican Baptists such as Samuel Sharpe. Its brutal suppression and the outrage which followed in Britain directly fed into the passing of Britain’s Slavery Abolition Act in 1833.</p>\n<p>Anticipation of the implementation of the Slavery Abolition Act, on 1 August 1834, seems to have created the sense that further missionary efforts would be needed during the period of apprenticeship that would follow for the enslaved. The January 1834 issue of the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> began with a report from Demerara and Bernice, declaring:</p>\n<p>the safe and satisfactory transition of the negroes from a state of bondage to one of freedom, must be an object of desire to every lover of his country, and every friend of human kind… But, in whatever light we may regard the past, it is impossible to look forward to the future without much anxiety. Nothing has diminished the evils and alleviated the pressure of slavery so much as the teaching, example, and influence of the Christian missionary; and nothing has operated so effectually to prepare the negroes for the great deliverance which now awaits them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Readers were told that around 800,000 British subjects would soon become free, creating an unrepeatable opportunity to ‘extend the benefits of education and religious instruction throughout the colonies’. According to the printed excerpts from missionary letters, there was a considerable desire for education among the enslaved, who sometimes even arranged their own reading classes without any missionary oversight or assistance.</p>\n<p>The Sunday School at Joseph Ketley’s Providence Chapel in George Town was regularly attended by 250 children and 430 adults, while the day school taught 150 children with a further 220 adults attending in the evening.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>  According to accounts sent to London by Ketley, his congregation had raised the equivalent of £529 sterling during the previous year.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The seven page article ended by declaring that the Directors were ‘anxious to meet the strong claims of the population of the colonies’ and were in the process of sending additional missionaries to Berbice and Demerara, in the hope that:</p>\n<p>the colonies may be spotted with the dwellings or villages of a contented, cheerful, sober, industrious, and Christian peasantry, forming an important and useful class among a free, intelligent, and happy people, blessed with all the privileges and enjoyments of religion here, and prepared to realise all the hopes it inspires in reference to immortality.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The following month, February 1834, saw the cover of the  <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> feature an ‘Appeal on Behalf of the West Indies’. This declared ‘The moral and religious instruction of the negroes in the West Indies is one of the most important duties now demanding the attention of the Christian public’:</p>\n<p>It is evidently the duty of those who have so long held the negro in a state as unnatural as it is unchristian to inform him, discreetly but fully, of the obligations which his new civil relations involve, and the duties which the station in society on which he is about to enter will impose; and to accomplish this, the instruction he receives must be decidedly Christian.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>There was clearly anxiety about the large numbers of formerly enslaved people about to become ‘free subjects of the British crown’, but the article asserted that the nation was responsible for the ‘moral and spiritual wrong, the cruelty to the soul, which slavery has inflicted’. It suggested some compensation might be offered through the ‘communication of the gospel’.</p>\n<p>While the nation had granted civil liberty, it fell to the ‘religious portion of the community’ to ‘give the mind emancipation, and to set the spirit free’. The Directors announced in capital letters their intention to send:</p>\n<p>FOURTEEN ORDAINED MISSIONARIES TO THE BRITISH COLONIES<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As well as sending further missionaries to Berbice and Demerara, a new mission would be established in Jamaica, home to around half of those anticipating emancipation and an established mission field of the British Baptist Missionary Society since 1814.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Directors appealed for ‘discreet, experienced, and truly devoted men’ to help ‘the Lord in this important work’, asking supporters for <em>special donations for the West India missions</em> to enable what would likely be ‘a very considerable increase to the permanent annual expenditure of the Society’. They quoted John Wray, the first missionary sent to Demerara (Chapter 5), in a letter sent from Berbice in late November 1833:</p>\n<p>Surely Britain, having accomplished the abolition of slavery, at least having fixed a period when it shall for ever cease, will furnish the means of instruction to these poor people, that they may be delivered from the slavery of sin and Satan, and brought into the glorious livery of the children of God. Will the British Parliament vote £20,000,000 for their temporal, and will not the Missionary Society contribute a few thousands for their spiritual freedom?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By May 1835, around £6,400 had been raised in a special fund for ‘West India Missions’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The most immediate needs of the newly emancipated, however, were imagined as spiritual and educational.</p>\n<p>It would be easy to be cynical, suggesting that mission education was a ruse to prepare skilled workers in ‘villages of a contented, cheerful, sober, industrious, and Christian peasantry’ for the emerging capitalist economy. Indeed, Missions were supported by many planters following emancipation, fore preciely these reasons, Nevertheless, education seems to have been enthusiastically embraced alongside Christianity by many who had previously been enslaved, although possibly not always on exactly the terms imagined by those writing these articles in London.</p>\n<p>Education carried an emancipatory appeal for people previously prevented from learning to read or write by planters, so they wouldn’t find out about political events in other parts of the world. Nonconformist Christianity had demonstrated itself to be an important tool in the resistance against planters interests, associated with the Demerara rebellion of 1823, the Jamaica rebellion of 1831, as well as through playing a significant role in promoting the cause of abolition within Britain itself.</p>\n<p>In January 1836, the Directors announced in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> that the British Parliament had made the sum of £20,000 available ‘<em>in aid of voluntary contributions towards the erection of School-Houses</em> in the colonies and settlements in which slavery had been abolished’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The scheme was modelled on a scheme established two years earlier for ‘the erection of schools for the education of the children of the poorer classes in Great Britain’, established following the Great Reform Act of 1833.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By May 1836, the LMS had been awarded £3000 from this grant.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Writing from Demerara in early June 1836, however, Joseph Ketley, expressed his concern about the conditions of the Government grant, which involved a requirement for regular Government inspections of mission schools. He told William Ellis, the Foreign Secretary, that he could not ‘help regarding it as another snare of the Devil by which to hinder the progress of the true emancipation of the souls of the negro man from his own vassalage’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The expansion of missionaries which followed led, at around the same time, to the Western Committee of the Board of Directors instructing the Demerara missionaries to form themselves into a District Committee.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Joseph Ketley resented this imposition of metropolitan power, feeling it contradicted the ‘fundamental principle’ of the Missionary Society in relation to Church governance.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ketley asserting that Providence Chapel had established itself as a self-sustaining Independent congregation, having raised nearly £1100 the previous year. This allowed it to cover the expenses of the Chapel, to support two missionary stations among the indigenous people of Demerara along the Essequibo River, as well as to send funds that supported the work of the LMS elsewhere in the world.</p>\n<p>His congregation, he suggested, acknowledged ‘no right of interference with it in any particular’, but the new Committee Regulations would allow them no voice in relation to their affairs, since it was composed entirely of British Missionaries.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Ketley refused to join the Committee, and when it tried to interfere with operations at one of his Church’s inland missions, under the care of Marcus Peters,  wrote to London in January 1837.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Soon after, the Directors delayed sending Ketley’s nephew, who wanted to join him in Demerara as a school teacher, making it clear something was seriously amiss.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> After waiting over eleven months for a response, Ketley received a letter from London  in May 1837 (dated 1 March), asking him to direct his communications through the new Committee, with whom his relationship had by then irreparably broken down.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ketley felt he had remained true to the instructions issued to him in 1828, and asked the British abolitionist and Congregationalist Minister John Scoble, visiting Demerara to examine the apprenticeship system instituted following emancipation in 1834, to make his case to the Directors in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Scoble was accompanied to London by Mr Carter, a senior Deacon of Providence Chapel.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>William Ellis and the Directors met with Carter in March 1838, who was ‘of the opinion that no measures which the Directors could adopt would secure the co-operation of Mr Ketley with the Committee’ in Demerara, partly because ‘the alienation of feeling between Mr Ketley and the brethren had existed prior to the formation of the Committee’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Carter told the Committee that the Congregation ‘wished to purchase the land on which the Chapel was built, also many of the buildings as belonged to the Society, at an appraised valuation’. The Committee proposed that Ketley appoint an appraiser and the District Committee another, concluding that:</p>\n<p>The case of Christ would be best promote by their not being united with the Demerara District Committee.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In noting that it was no longer listed alongside the Society’s stations in the Annual Report of 1838, the Directors described Ketley:</p>\n<p>As a faithful, efficient, and devoted Missionary Christ, and their unfeigned gratitude for the truly encouraging measure of success which, under the blessing of the Most High, has attended his labours in the important post to which the Great Head of the Church has called him. Towards Mr Ketley personally, and the people of his charge, the Director desire to cherish cordial and fraternal affection, and while continuing to feel the most lively interest in their welfare, will be happy to receive their aid and co-operation in carrying forward the work in which the Society is engaged.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In a letter considered at a meeting of the West Indies Committee on 25 May 1838, Ketley declared that neither he nor his people wanted to separate from the Society, but onto to ‘secure the privileges &amp; immunities of Children who no longer need to be under Tutors &amp; Governors’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At a meeting at Providence Chapel on 27 July 1838, less than a week before the apprenticeship system ended, in part due to Scoble’s report, the Church agreed a number of resolutions in response to a letter sent by William Ellis on 14 April.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The Directors had declared that the end of the Church’s relationship with the London Missionary Society, like most divorces, would entail a financial settlement.</p>\n<p>After the first minister of Providence Chapel, Davies, had died, the Directors had paid his wife £1000 to transfer ownership of the chapel and the ground on which it stood. The chapel had been rebuilt in around 1830 at a cost of £3000, of which £400 had been supplied by the Directors. The Directors evidently expected to be recompensed for these, as well as other expenses. The Church declared, however, that:</p>\n<p>considering all the circumstances of this Station, any claim &amp; demands made by the Directors on any part of which, ought to be regarded as unjust in Principle &amp; oppressive in enforcement.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sending an initial payment shortly after emancipation day on 1 August 1838, Ketley noted that no fewer than 2,400 people had attended services at Providence Chapel, at which tears flowed down many cheeks. According to Ketley ‘The people universally feel that God has done it and not Man’, and when Ketley asked one man how he felt, was told ‘It feel as if the Great Massa be passing by, when he blow away all the bad, and blow all the good upon us’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In October 1838, Ketley sent £400, raised from the congregation to repay the money lent for the new chapel in 1834, while refusing to pay to purchase the land on which the chapel stood. Ketley explained that the Church remained in debt, but that this was now ‘among our own people who will be patient till we can pay them.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He noted that ‘my people have felt exceedingly hurt &amp; surprised that the Directors… should have spoken about having a claim on the Grant of £100 made in 1832’ for the infant school, the only grant made since Ketley arrived in 1828:</p>\n<p>We do not know how to construe the Directors demands &amp; claims after they have acknowledged our having fulfilled their highest expectations &amp; express so much pleasure &amp; delight… It seems to us as though the more a people strive to disburden the Society, the more determinately the Society burdens them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In July 1839, Ketley arrived in London and requested a meeting with the Directors ‘to negotiate with you for the final adjustment of the differences which have unhappily arisen between us and you’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By October, it had been agreed that the Chapel property would be placed in Trust. It was the first time in LMS history a Church had left the fold, which made both Ketley and the Directors conscious of the precedent they were establishing.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> When it was proposed that all the Trustees be resident in England, the congregation in Georgetown communicated ‘surprise and regret’ to Ketley, still in England. They pointed out the complications likely to result from such an arrangement, and resented the implication that no suitable trustees could be found in a Church which had proved itself capable of sustaining itself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> A resolution at the Annual Meeting of the London Missionary Society in May 1840 approved the recommendation of the Directors to convey the property which had:</p>\n<p>hitherto been legally held by Mr Ketley, in the name of the London Missionary Society, to trustees for the use and benefit of said church, subject to such trusts as may be necessary for securing the continuance of the faithful preaching of the Gospel of Christ, and the administration of Divine ordinances.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ketley remained in England where he attended the Anti-Slavery convention at Exeter Hall in June 1840. He was depicted beside John Scoble, near the front of a famous painting showing Thomas Clarkson, one of the funders of the <em>Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade</em> in 1787, addressing the event.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it was agreed that at least half the trustees should come from the congregation. Six were appointed at a meeting of the Church in December 1840, after Ketley’s return from England. Six others were appointed by the Society in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In April 1841, Ketley wrote again to London, complaining that the church seemed to have been ‘completely discarded by the Society’ and ‘cast off as unworthy’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> They had not been sent any news of the Society’s work or copies of Missionary publications. For Ketley and his congregation, freedom for their Church paralleled the freedom granted to those who had been enslaved, which made their argument with the Directors about the nature and principle of liberty.</p>\n<p>The Missionary Society had asserted a new form or control over mission congregations through District Committees, paralleling the system of apprenticeship by which freedom from slavery was delayed and ultimately constrained. This new form of governance placed greater control in the hands of British missionaries, undermining principles of Congregational independence.</p>\n<p>Ketley and his congregation wanted to convert their dependent relationship with the London Missionary Society, expressed as like that between a parent and child, into one of equality and adulthood.  Writing on behalf of his congregation, Ketley addressed the Directors as ‘Dear and Honoured Brethren’, using the language of Christian brotherhood to assert the right to be recognised as ‘brethren’ in return.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ketley was concerned that barriers were being placed in ‘the way of people ever acting for themselves’. He felt the new committee arrangements could also be taken advantage of by missionaries with ’a despotic mind’, suggesting that ‘should the Missionary himself prefer his ease to his obligations – or should be think it better to keep the people in what he may think their place – their case is hopeless’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 7 January 1842, Ketley wrote to Arthur Tidman and J.J. Freeman, newly appointed Foreign Secretaries following the resignation of William Ellis on health grounds in 1841. While he welcomed their declarations of goodwill, and assurances that the failure to send Missionary publications had been an oversight, he complained about plans for “Smith’s Chapel” in Georgetown.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> According to the Society’s Annual Report for 1842, this was intended to become the basis of a seminary that would train up ‘an efficient native agency for the service of the West India Mission’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At around the same time, however, the position of church leaders in the Caribbean became the focus for a very public moral panic among British evangelicals. The earliest Baptist preachers in Jamaica had been African Americans, arriving on the island following American Independence in 1783. The English missionaries who arrived after 1813 at their invitation frequently only had relatively limited influence over their sometimes very large congregations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Representatives of other missionary societies on the island may well have resented the relative success and material comfort of Baptist Missionaries, but also recognised that Jamaican Baptists sometimes approached Christianity rather differently to many European churches. Congregations were generally organised into ‘classes’, each led by a ‘daddy’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> These leaders often seem to have sometimes resented the oversight and instruction of White Baptist missionaries.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Concerns, expressed privately over around a decade, spilled over into a pamphlet war in England from 1841 onwards. William Knibb, a prominent Baptist Missionary in Jamaica, was evidently extremely irritated by his critics from the Scottish Missionary Society, writing in a private letter in April 1841 that:</p>\n<p>If the time spent by some missionaries in back-biting, and slandering, and in the anonymous scribbling against us in newspapers, were devoted even to the temporal welfare of the people, it would at least be equally consistent with the principles of religion.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When three LMS missionaries in Jamaica, John Vine, William Slatyer and W.G. Barrett added their voices to the criticisms, Knibb became even more vociferous:</p>\n<p>I could not, I did not, for a long time believe it; but now I would much rather receive into my house the vilest slave-owner Jamaica ever produced, than some of the agents of the London Missionary Society. I feel no enmity to them, but such mean snake-like crawling conduct inspires my unqualified disgust. Under anonymous signatures, and through the vilest papers, they have attacked us.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In January 1842, a meeting of Baptists from across Jamaica sent William Knibb to England to represent their interests. Under Knibb’s guidance, they also decided Jamaican Churches should take responsibility for their own support from 1 August 1842, partly in response to charges of extravagance in the furnishing of mission houses and chapels.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The controversy even found its way into the usually staid <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> in March 1842, when a letter was printed that responded to a document published by the Baptist Missionary Society to refute some of the charges against it. The letter summarised the main charges as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>abuse of office by class leaders, described as tyrannical and often illiterate</li>\n<li>adoption of a ‘ticket system’ for attending communion, for which payment was received – the tickets sometimes becoming an object of superstitious veneration</li>\n<li>too rash and indiscriminate admission of people to church membership, without knowledge of the real character of those baptised</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The letter in question suggested Knibb, as well as other Baptist missionaries, genuinely believed in the sincerity of the congregations under their care, but suggested that for ‘a number of independent and creditable witnesses’ to have raised these concerns, there must have been some genuine issues at play.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>What certainly seems to have been the case was that Jamaican Christians were in the process of developing forms of religious practice which blended Christianity with African ways of understanding and approaching the world. Hope Waddell from the Scottish Missionary Society suggested that ‘The grand doctrine of these people was the Spirit’s teaching. It gave life. The written word was a dead letter’. The spirit was sought in dreams and visions, and preparation for baptism sometimes involved spending time in the wilderness waiting for signs.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Hugh Brown, an LMS schoolmaster stated that it was commonly believed that full body baptism not only washed away sin, but provided knowledge, making White missionaries unnecessary “because dem know all him can tell them”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> John Clark of the Baptist Mission at Brown’s Town in Jamaica’s North, seems to have been proud that his congregation established its own prayer meetings with independently chosen leaders.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>An extremely revealing visual source on contemporary Baptist practices comes in the form of a colour print, produced in 1842 by George Baxter showing the baptism of 135 people in the sea near Brown’s Town in 1842. While two White British missionaries perform the sacrament in the water while a third preaches from a raised pulpit on the beach, the image is filled by people of African descent, some on horses, others in boats, wearing an array of variously coloured clothing.</p>\n<p>Beginning near Montego Bay in late 1841, there seems to have been a revival of practices of purification, featuring the curing of illness alongside the removal of evil influences. This was possibly influenced by recent arrivals of large numbers of Africans, liberated from captured slaving vessels.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The combination of drumming, dancing and spirit possession which occurred parallels practices from across sub-Saharan Africa, associated with what have been called ‘cults of affliction’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In Jamaica these practices were called Myal, and were understood to oppose the negative influences of Obeah or sorcery.</p>\n<p>Hope Waddell, a prominent Scottish Missionary Society critic of the Baptists, described a ‘wild outbreak of Myalism in 1842’ as ‘one of the most startling events in the history of the Jamaica missions, and showed how deeply rooted the old heathenism of their race still was among the negroes’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He encountered a group of Christians who claimed to have been sent by God to purify the world. They formed a ring of people, inside of which a group of women:</p>\n<p>performed a mystic dance, sailing round and round, and wheeling in the centre with outspread arms, and wild looks and gestures. Others hummed and shuttled a low monotonous tune, to which the performers kept time, as did the people around also, by hands and feet and swaying of bodies.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Waddell entered the circle he was at first ignored, and then invited to sing a hymn. Disturbed by the dancing this inspired, he prayed instead. The group soon returned to singing and dancing. He then addressed the man who seemed to be overseeing the ceremony in impatient terms:</p>\n<p>“If you don’t keep these mad women quiet, we cannot go on with the worship of God” Thereupon a strange hubbub arose. “They are not mad.” “They have the spirit.” “You must be mad yourself and had best go away.” “Let the women go on; we don’t want you.” “Who brought you here?” “What do you want with us?”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Standing on a chair, Waddell attempted to preach to the crowd, but this only provoked them. Waddell directed his followers to disrupt their attempts to ‘make ring”, at which point:</p>\n<p>The women thus baffled became frantic, and dashed themselves from side to side, driving over some of their own class, and tearing themselves with rage.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Such accounts alarmed the evangelical supporters of mission in Britain. In late 1842, Rev. J.J. Freeman, one of the London Missionary Society’s Foreign Secretaries, was sent to the West Indies on a tour of inspection by the Directors, arriving back in Britain on 20 April 1843.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Addressing the Society’s Annual meeting on 11 May, Freeman told the assembled supporters of the Society that he had travelled first to British Guiana and then to Jamaica, where he encountered:</p>\n<p>congregations of men so lately in bondage… and so manifestly affording the earnest of the future prosperity of those countries as the industrious, sober-minded and increasingly intelligent and religious peasantry of those portions of the British Empire.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Freeman described congregations that were ‘well clad, well behaved, eager to listen, to understand, to believe and to be saved’. He was impressed by the large amounts given to Church and missionary causes, estimating that a total greater than £250,000 had been raised across the different denominations in Jamaica and British Guiana since emancipation in 1834.</p>\n<p>He felt he had seen ‘a large amount of <em>real</em>, but not of <em>highly enlightened</em> piety’, manifested by a strong desire to ‘have their own minister, their own chapel, and to be identified with a religious party, and do something to sustain it by personal effort and sacrifice’, a condition he felt was a ‘transition state’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Freeman also described visiting Smith Chapel in George Town. Although he noted plans for a Seminary in George Town, it is possibly significant that these did not develop in subsequent years. Freeman also described visiting  ‘my old friend Mr. Ketley, formerly this Society’s faithful and laborious agent there’:</p>\n<p>Few Missionaries have been more honoured in doing good: and there are few stations, in my opinion, of greater usefulness in Great Britain, or any part of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>During his visit, the congregation at New Providence Chapel even made a donation of £50 to assist ‘the persecuted native Christians from Madagascar’ (Chapter 19), where Freeman had previously served as a missionary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Freeman’s report anticipated that the Mission Churches of the West Indies would, like New Providence Chapel and the Baptist congregations in Jamaica, be ‘in a position to support themselves ere long, without pressing on the funds of the Parent Society’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> With an expansion into China underway (Chapter 16), and annual expenditure having been at least £7,000 higher than income during the previous three years, such savings were keenly sought.</p>\n<p>Month later, the missionary ship <em>Camden</em> (Chapter 15) returned to London after five years in the Pacific and a major appeal was soon launched for a larger ship (Chapter 23). However, it was only in 1845, the London Missionary Society’s Jubilee, that Income once again exceeded Expenditure.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was not until 1867 that the London Missionary Society eventually made the decision to withdraw its support for missionary operations in the Caribbean, a gradual process that was not completed until 1884.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> At least part of the reason for this was a decline in the wages paid to the free people of the West Indies, a consequence of the arrival of large numbers of indentured labourers from India.</p>\n<p>The first shipload arrived to work on the sugar plantations of John Gladstone in British Guiana just as apprenticeship ended in 1838. Pressure from humanitarians, Scoble among them, prevented further arrivals between 1839 and 1845. As a consequence, the cost of producing sugar more than quadrupled for most plantations in British Guiana, while the volume produced decreased significantly.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The prosperity of Caribbean congregations such as New Providence Chapel immediately after emancipation was closely linked to the high wages available, but this also proved to be a temporary ‘transition state’. By 1848, the impact of reducing wages was already considerable and W.G. Barrett reported to the Annual Missionary Meeting in London that there were in Demerara:</p>\n<p>hundreds, nay, thousands of people, who would be willing to work if they could get employment; but even if they did, they could not get paid for it.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By June 1850, the influence of ‘deep and universal poverty on the resources of the Mission Churches’ in the West Indies was noted in the <em>Missionary Magazine</em>:</p>\n<p>“During the last year,” writes Mr. Pettigrew, of Berbice, “we have often been asked for bread by those who, only a short time ago, have large sums of money to the cause of God.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 14 December 1849, Joseph Ketley marked his birthday by writing to the Directors of the London Missionary Society about their gift:</p>\n<p>This day completes the 47<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> year of my earthly pilgrimage, and the 21<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> of my public service in the Guiana field of Missions<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Comparing the 1849 to 1828  when he arrived in Demerara, Ketley noted:</p>\n<p>Then as a Messenger of the Church, I was dependant on your help. Now as the independent pastor of a truly independent people, I am privileged to minister to your’s. In this capacity it is my privilege this day to address yo you these lines, in cheerful response to yours accepting the offer of the specimens of Natural History for your Missionary Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Following his arrival in October, Ketley had visited Arthur Tidman, the Society’s Foreign Secretary, to tell him he would send the specimen ‘after being filled up’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> It had been taken, he noted, not far from our Missionary stations up the Demerara River. It was accompanied by a further gift of more that fifty pounds ‘in furtherance of the Society’s Mission in Heathen lands’, intended primarily to support the extension of LMS Missions in mainland China (Chapter 16).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ketley then set the record straight, using his letter to record his version of the events which led to the independence of his congregation. He hoped these gifts, and their acceptance by the Directors, marked ‘the renewal of fraternal intercourse’ which had long been interrupted.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>An image of the Missionary Museum, published in April 1853, shows a glass case containing the alligator wrapped in the coils of a boa constructor near its centre, immediately in front of the Giraffe and behind the case containing the model house from South Africa (Chapter 17).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By 1860, this had been moved to a display case dedicated to Natural History. Surrounded by shells, corals and animal horns, it was positioned below an even bigger stuffed snake, originally from Bengal, wrapped around a tree trunk.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> While the larger serpent possibly evokes the temptation of Eve by Satan in the Garden of Eden, we can read the alligator and boa constrictor, locked in their seemingly eternal embrace, according to an alternative symbolic frame.</p>\n<p>To me at least, it captures something of the struggles of the congregation and pastor of the New Providence Chapel in Demerara to achieve their independence from the London Missionary Society. But this struggle also mirrors a wider contemporary struggle, as those emancipated from slavery sought a future for themselves and their descendants as free subjects of the British Empire.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.</p>\n<p>10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.

Christian Martyr’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Showing only the sitter’s head and shoulders and wearing a plain white lamba, this is clearly not the full-length portrait Ellis described making in the morning on 25 September. Was Rainitsontsoraka photographed by Ellis on more than one occasion?</p>\n<p>Photography was still a new way of making images in 1856. Louis Daguerre developed the daguerreotype process in France during the 1830s, resulting in a unique image on a metal plate that could not be easily reproduced. In the early 1840s, William Henry Fox Talbot created the calotype process in Britain, resulting in waxed paper negatives, but prints made from these tended to be marked by the texture of the paper on which they were made. It was the wet collodion process, popularised in the early 1850s, that made high quality images considerably easier to reproduce.</p>\n<p>The process began by covering a glass plate with sticky collodion, a solution of cellulose nitrate in ether and alcohol. The plate would then be immersed in a bath of silver nitrate inside a portable darkroom for several minutes, before being put into a plate holder to protect it from the light. Loaded into a camera, it could be exposed before being developed and fixed, all within a span of 15 minutes before the collodion dried.  By passing light through the clear plate glass, multiple images could then be printed from the resulting negative.</p>\n<p>Ellis seems to have learned to make photographs this way from Roger Fenton, employed by The British Museum as a photographer in 1853.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In 1854, Fenton made the first photographs of Queen Victoria and the British royal family, but it was his photographs from the Crimean War the following year, used to create images for the <em>Illustrated London News</em> (established in 1842), which made him famous.</p>\n<p>Fenton’s own engagement with photography began when he visited the Great Exhibition in 1851, housed in a building made from 60,000 identical panes of plate glass known as the Crystal Palace. Photography brought together knowledge from chemistry and optics, but the wet collodium process, like the Crystal Palace itself, was possible due to fairly recent developments in the mechanical production of standardised plate glass.</p>\n<p>Although glass had long served to confine artefacts in museum display cases, where they could be used for illustrations in books and periodicals, wet collodion negatives achieved something significantly different. They captured an unchanging simulacrum on their actual surface, meaning nothing three-dimensional need exist behind it. In the twenty-first century, we live in a bewildering world saturated by similarly opaque flat screens. Can this artefact from the beginning of the age of glass help us to better understand our own times?</p>\n<p>William Ellis’ attention was drawn to Madagascar during the early 1830s. Following the success of his book, _Polynesian Researche_s, published in 1829 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/principal-kinds-of-native-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 7</a>), he seems to have increasingly engaged in writing and editing alongside the tours he undertook promoting the London Missionary Society (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/13-all-wrapped-up-in-a-piece-of-tahitian-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 13</a>).</p>\n<p>According to the <em>Preface</em> of <em>The History of Madagascar,</em> published in 1838, the Directors asked Ellis to prepare this for publication in early 1833, around the time he was appointed Foreign Secretary, ‘adding such information as could be obtained from publications in this country’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The resulting two-volume work has recently been described in potentially hyperbolic terms as ‘one of the major acts of nineteenth-century historical literary fraud’, largely because its title page omits the name of David Griffiths, an early Welsh missionary to Madagascar.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This would suggest a deliberate attempt to deceive, but its title page states that the work was:</p>\n<p>Compiled chiefly from Original Documents, BY THE REV. WILLIAM ELLIS, Foreign Secretary of the London Missionary Society<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Personally, I read this as a declaration of ‘Editorship’ rather than ‘Authorship’, and the Preface which follows begins by declaring:</p>\n<p>The materials for a large portion of the following work, were collected by the Missionaries in the island to which it relates, and forwarded to this country in the year 1830.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is true that none of the names of these missionaries appear on the title page, but the decision to only include the name of the editor may have been a pragmatic one, intended to calm an active rift among the Madagascar Missionaries at the time.</p>\n<p>Johannes Van der Kemp, leader of the first mission to South Africa in 1799 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a>), had planned to travel to Madagascar from the Cape in 1811 (Chapter 3), but his death that year meant that these plans were temporarily abandoned.</p>\n<p>In 1814, John Le Brun, an LMS missionary from Jersey in Britain’s (bilingual) Channel Islands, began a mission to Mauritius, which had been a British possession since 1810.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Le Brun, however, held back from visiting the much larger neighbouring island, described in the first lines of the <em>History of Madagascar</em> as ‘the Great Britain of Africa’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In August 1818, a pair of young Welsh missionaries, David Jones and Thomas Bevan, sailed to the island from Mauritius. By February 1819, Bevan, his wife and child, as well as the wife and child of Jones had all died, leaving Jones extremely unwell. He returned to Mauritius in July 1819.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In September 1820, however, Jones returned to Madagascar with James Hastie, agent for Robert Farquhar, the British Governor of Mauritius, who was keen to establish a treaty with Radama I that would end the island’s export of slaves. Radama evidently recognised the advantages that European technologies, perhaps especially firearms, offered for his growing Kingdom, embracing the opportunity by writing to the London Missionary Society Directors to send teachers ‘provided you send skilful artisans to make my people workmen, as well as good Christians’. He also seems to have been particularly interested in adopting and adapting European forms of dress.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In May 1821, David Griffiths arrived at Antananarivo where he established a school. Radama also sent ten members of his extended family to be educated in Mauritius, and ten more to England, accompanied by his own brother-in-law, Prince Rataffe, whose image appeared in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> in January 1822.</p>\n<p>In the years that followed, literacy was rapidly adopted across the Kingdom, with thousands of Malagasy learning to read and write, as those taught by the missionaries taught others in turn. The New Testament had been translated into Malagasy by August 1825, and in September 1826 a printing press arrived in Antananarivo, along with another Welsh missionary called David Jones. He changed his surname to Johns to distinguish himself from his older namesake.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By the time the first catalogue of the Missionary Museum was published in 1826, the museum included a case that displayed fourteen ‘Manufactures of Madagascar’, presented by Robert Farquhar, the Governor of Mauritius, who returned to Britain in 1823 ‘to whom the society is greatly indebted for his friendly exertions in favour of the Madagascar Mission’. As well as tools and samples of cotton clothing, it included a spear presented to Farquhar by the King, Radama I.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In October 1826, James Hastie died, increasing French influence at the royal court. September 1827 saw the arrival of the Rev. Joseph John Freeman, an English Congregational Minister appointed by the Directors. His task was to wrest control of the Madagascar Mission from Jones and Griffiths, although Freeman’s efforts were very effectively resisted by his Welsh-speaking brethren.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The travelling ‘Deputation’, Daniel Tyerman and George Bennett, arrived at Antananarivo on 21 July 1828. Radama I was extremely ill and passed away soon afterwards, followed three days later by Daniel Tyerman. Court intrigue and a bloody succession struggle followed, with the throne ultimately taken by Ranavalona, one of Radama’s wives, whose supporters seemed keen to reassert more traditional ceremonial practices.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Without Tyerman’s guidance, Bennet allowed the four missionaries an equal role in the running of the mission, rather than confirming Freeman’s oversight. This did little to resolve their conflict, especially as the new Queen increasingly treated David Griffiths, with whom she had a longstanding relationship, as the main representative of both the Missionaries and the British state. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1829, Hastie’s replacement as British Agent, Robert Lyall, was arrested for sorcery and expelled from the island. Having associated himself closely with Lyall, Freeman left soon afterwards, and began a vituperative letter writing campaign against Griffiths.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By 1830, the New Testament translation had been completed, feeding an increasing interest in Christianity that led to a number of baptisms. The LMS Board, however, attempted to recall Griffiths in August 1831, but when Freeman returned to the island to enforce their instructions, he found the Royal court reluctant to part with its favourite missionary.</p>\n<p>In April 1833, the LMS Board formally dissolved their connection with Griffiths, refusing to pay his bills, so he began trading, including with donations made by missionary supporters in Britain, leading Freeman to accuse him of ‘absolute fraud’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>These tensions did little to reassure Ranavalona of the good intentions of Christians, especially when a local prophet promised that slaves would soon be freed and all would be equals. Such radical eschatological egalitarianism would likely unsettle any Queen!</p>\n<p>In March 1835, Queen Ranavalona proclaimed an end to practices that challenged the customs of her ancestors, even outlawing Christian books. By the end of June, the complete Bible was printed in Malagasy and secretly distributed, with seventy copies buried on the island (Chapter 28).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By September 1836, the majority of missionaries had left the island, eighteen years after Bevan and Jones first arrived. Editing the <em>History of Madagascar</em> as these turbulent events unfolded, Ellis seems to have paused the work, only to be given access to the manuscript journals of James Hastie by Lord Glenelg (Charles Grant), Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1835 to 1839 and an ally of the humanitarian faction.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The arrival in Britain of Jones, Griffiths and Baker, the missionary printer from Madagascar, allowed Ellis to check the contents of the <em>History’s</em> for accuracy, and to further expand the work (at least according to its preface). In early 1837, two senior members of the Merina court, both former missionary scholars, came to London as an embassy from the royal court, prompting Freeman’s return from Cape Town.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In early 1838, news reached Britain of the martyrdom of Rasalama the previous August, the first Malagasy Christian to be put to death for refusing to recant in the face of persecution (initially identified as Rafaravavy, and referred to as such in the subtitle of the <em>History of Madagascar</em>). Further persecutions followed, with some Christians escaping to Mauritius. Six of these found their way to England, where they addressed missionary meetings during the summer of 1839.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1838, the year in which <em>The History of Madagascar</em> was published, David Griffiths and his son returned to Madagascar as private traders. A number of Christians attempted to escape the island during this period, but when a group assisted by Griffiths was caught in 1840, they were executed and he was expelled.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>David Jones, the original missionary to Madagascar died at Mauritius in May 1841, followed by David Johns in August 1843. On his return to Britain in 1842, David Griffiths published his own account of events, <em>Hanes Madagascar</em>, an alternative history of Madagascar in the Welsh language.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Missionary work at Madagascar effectively ceased, and though further persecutions followed in 1849, the Malagasy Christian Church persisted underground. A false report of the death of Queen Ranavalona reached London in early 1852, and rumours of other changes prompted William Ellis, approaching the age of sixty, to volunteer to visit the island for the first time.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>William Ellis left England on 14 April 1853 in the <em>Indiana</em>, a ‘fine iron screw steam-ship’, on which he found the engine room ‘a place of great attraction… where the wonderful adjustment of the vast machinery, and easy working of the whole, notwithstanding the motion of the sea, often excited intense admiration’. He learned from the Scottish engineer that under full force the ship used thirty tons of coal a day, its propeller making 3540 revolutions an hour, each propelling them nineteen feet forwards.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Another consequence of the steam engine was the sixty gallons of fresh water it condensed each day, a significant luxury compared to sea voyages Ellis had completed under sail three decades earlier. After refuelling at St. Vincent, the vessel reached Ascension on 6 May, where Ellis attempted to make some photographs. When he developed the negatives, however, he discovered they were significantly overexposed, even though he significantly reduced the exposure time he would have used in England.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 22 May, the <em>Indiana</em> arrived at Cape Town, the Colony having recently been granted a parliament in which the franchise was racially blind (but restricted to males with property worth over £25). Ellis met James Cameron, a missionary artisan at Madagascar between 1826 and 1835, who was to accompany him on his journey. Cameron was the first person at the Cape to use the calotype process, in 1848, and had been making daguerreotypes professionally since 1850.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The pair left four days later, on 26 May, and by 7 June had arrived at Mauritius. There they met John Le Brun, still serving as an LMS missionary after nearly forty years, now assisted by his two sons.</p>\n<p>Ellis was extremely sea-sick on the weeklong voyage to Madagascar, made on a small schooner, and on arrival was confronted on arrival by the ‘revolting spectacle’ of the skulls of some of the twenty-one sailors who had been killed during an unsuccessful combined French and British attack on the town in June 1845, fixed onto high poles at Tamatave, a port on the East of the island.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>A canoe approached with the harbour master, asking who they were in ‘imperfect English’. When told they brought a letter for the queen from the traders at Mauritius, they were told she had already demanded compensation for the 1845 attack:</p>\n<p>He asked if it was right to go to a country and shoot down the people because we did not like their laws? He soon informed us that he had been a member of the embassy sent to Europe in 1837; that he had visited France and England, and knew that whoever went to reside in either of these countries must be subject to the laws of the county so long as they remained there<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>They sent letters to Cameron’s old friends in Antananarivo, as well as to the Queen, requesting to visit the capital. During the time they spent waiting at the coast for a reply, Ellis attempted to learn Malagasy, and was struck that many words appeared the same as those he knew form Eastern Polynesia. He also made a collection of plants, some of which he presented to the Crystal Palace on his return.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis and Cameron showed photographs to local officials who ‘expressed a strong desire to have their likenesses taken before we left’. Bringing ashore ‘the daguerreotype apparatus, as that process could be most readily employed’ they set this up in a house loaned by a French trader, presenting the resulting portraits to the sitters, who were ‘much delighted’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While making a portrait of ‘the son of the late judge of the district’, they were visited by Ratranombolo, a diviner famous on the island. Impressed, he asked for his own portrait. Since they were making daguerreotypes, most sitters agreed to have two images made, one for themselves and another to be kept by Ellis and Cameron. Keen to control his own image, Ratranombolo, refused to allow a second portrait to be made. When they would not agree to make only one, he left.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When the Queen’s reply arrived, it advised them to leave. Ellis and Cameron departed for Mauritius on 9 August, where merchants soon raised 15,000 silver dollars to pay the Queen’s indemnity. Cameron returned to Madagascar with one of the merchants to present this while Ellis explored Mauritius, including visiting the chapel on land purchased by the London Missionary Society for refugees from Madagascar.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Towards the end of November, Cameron returned on a ship carrying 93 oxen, trade having reopened with Madagascar. Ellis, however, was still struggling to achieve good results from his photographs. Given how different the conditions were to those in England, it proved hard to be sure of the cause so he engaged Dr Powell, superintendent at the Mauritius Asylum, who was ‘familiar with chemistry, and had recently commenced the practice of photography’. Ellis had taken with him ‘a considerable quantity of carefully packed waxed and iodised paper’, presumably intended for Fox Talbot’s calotype process, although he struggled to succeed with this method of image making.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>During the heat of the southern hemisphere summer, Ellis visited a sugar plantation employing 356 Indian labourers owned by M. Chéron, ‘a person of colour, and a man of great force and character, as well as industry and intelligence’. Chéron was a member of Le Brun’s congregation, and in the evening Ellis entertained his family with ‘my photographs and stereoscope’. A number of photographs of Chéron and his plantation survive today at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In January 1854, the Governor of Mauritius received an invitation from Madagascar to ‘send for the skulls’ so they could be buried, although the person sent to retrieve them found the French had already taken them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> At the end of that month, Ellis visited another plantation where he successfully photographed a jack tree, complete with large fruits, inviting an Indian labourer into the frame as a human scale. An engraving of this image would feature in his account of his travels, published in 1859.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In early May 1854, when he felt the risk of summer disease (likely malaria) was receding at Madagascar, Ellis sent another request for permission to visit Antananarivo. There was an outbreak of cholera at Mauritius, but Ellis decided to leave for Madagascar in early June. The customs officers at Tamatave were understandably nervous about the arrival of the ship, asking them to quarantine on board for eight days.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Ellis eventually had his things taken ashore, his various bottles of photographic chemicals were mistaken by the customs officers for medicine. When he asked about his request to visit the capital, he was told he was expected to travel with Cameron, who had returned to the Cape. At the coast, Ellis attempted to learn Malagasy while practising his photography.</p>\n<p>An image of the house in which he stayed, featured in his 1859 book, seems to have been a composite, assembled from a number of different images he made at this time – photographs as well as sketches.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At a celebration of the Malagasy new year, to which he was invited, Ellis encountered officers and officials wearing gold epaulets and cocked hats with feathers. He even spotted buttons bearing the American eagle and shield. After dinner they entered a room in which the walls were covered with French paper ‘representing scenes in the different campaigns of Napoleon’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When news of the worsening epidemic at Mauritius reached Madagascar, including the deaths of the family with whom Ellis had stayed, he was told that it would be impossible for him to visit the capital. Visitors continued to arrive to see him, and when they inspected his copy of the <em>History of Madagascar,</em> were particularly interested by the Baxter colour print showing Rafaralahy, Governor of Foule Point, who was known to many of the visitors.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>A shield, not unlike the one he is shown holding was loaned from the Missionary Museum to the British Museum in 1890 (Af, LMS.1), although it does not seem to feature in nineteenth century catalogues of the Missionary museum until the exhibition at Paris in 1867 (Chapter 20). The catalogue that was published around 1860, however, refers to this image in its description of an ornament made of large silver claws and glass beads, which appears on Rafaralahy’s chest.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis’s visitors also expressed a great deal of interest in his photographic apparatus. He told them it was used for ‘taking people’s likenesses in a minute of two by means of the sun or the light’, and many asked him for portraits. One man quickly slipped home, returning with a large bundle of clothes, carried by one of his servants. This included ‘a handsome scarlet lamba and other attractive articles of dress’ he intended to wear for his portrait.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>He was disappointed when told him Ellis needed time to assemble the camera and darkroom, and that the colour of the lamba wouldn’t appear in the monochrome image. Once Ellis prepared the necessary chemicals, he began making images using the wet collodion process. When he made positive prints from these a few days later, people were delighted, fetching friends and relatives who engaged in a long conversation ‘about how it could be done’:</p>\n<p>One man said it was <em>zanahary</em>, — a word they sometimes use for God, but by which they probably meant wonderful or supernatural.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This spectacle seems to have prompted a stream of inquirers, all after their own photographs. Ellis regarded this as an opportunity to meet people he would not otherwise have come across, enabling long and interesting conversations with men of importance. The process was not without hitches, however, and he suspected that some of his chemicals had deteriorated.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>People were immediately keen to frame the resulting images, some bringing large pieces of glass to be cut to the right size while others proposed ‘rubbing the quicksilver from the back of looking-glasses’. This substitution of a reflected simulacrum with a permanent ageless photographic one seems to suggest that a permanent and idealised image was valued more highly than a temporary and realistic one.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis tells us that people were scrupulous about removing their grey hairs and other marks of age, so perhaps an ageless image was intended to preserve their youthful appearance for posterity. He also made a number of photographs of the scenery on wax paper using the calotype process, but these proved of little interest compared to ‘the intense interest excited by the portraits’ in which:</p>\n<p>the aspect, the dress, the ornaments, and all the little accompaniments were subjects of curious examination and animated remark by wives and children, as well as companions and friends. One man had a mole on his cheek, and, as it was on the side next the light, it came to clear and strong; nothing excited more remark than this. I saw the man himself after feeling the mole on his cheek with his finger, go and touch the mole on the picture hanging up to dry, exclaiming, “How very wonderful! I never felt anything here,” putting his finger to his the mole on his cheek, “and yet there it is,” pointing to the picture.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This prompted Ellis to suggest ‘evident anxiety about personal appearance’ was common to all humans, noting:</p>\n<p>I never suggested the arrangement of the dress of the hair; but rarely found any one come and sit for a likeness without giving some previous attention to one or both. Even the labouring woman, returning from work in the field, with her child at her back, as shown on the adjoining page, when asked if she would have her likeness taken, adjusted her burden before having her <em>tout ensemble</em> rendered permanent.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Women came with servants to arrange their hair, while men brought a mirror and comb, sometimes asking for a bowl of water to moisten their hair.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately, Ellis’s photographs prompted him to compare both the dress and the physical appearance of the various subjects of his photographs. He commented on differences in hair styles between Hova and Betsimasaraka women, and was ‘struck with the remarkably European cast of many of their countenances’, suggesting that:</p>\n<p>Phrenologically they are a fine people, having frequently high foreheads with a considerable amount of those developments which are supposed to indicate intellectual capacity, as well as moral excellence.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>These comments were followed in his published account with a portrait of ‘a Hova chief’, said to ‘exhibit a type of head that I met with occasionally on the coast and at the capital’. Ellis commented on the slightness of the ‘olive tinge’ in the man’s complexion, suggesting that among the Hovas this was generally less ‘than is frequently seem amongst the inhabitants of the south of Europe’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis went on to suggest that ‘many of the Hovas possessed remarkably well-formed heads’, with well-shaped foreheads, even where the space between the eyebrows and the hair was narrow. Their eyes were never large or projecting, their eyebrows well defined without being heavy, their ‘nose frequently aquiline and firm, never thick and fleshy’, and their lips slightly projecting though ‘seldom round and large’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While this seems to evaluate Hova according to the degree to which they approached a northern European physical ideal, Ellis conceded that this did not apply to skin tone since ‘the colour of some of the Hovas is as dark as that of the most swarthy races in the island’, although he asserted that other features ‘exhibit the peculiar form of the European’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis evidently hoped his photographs would ‘prove acceptable to any who may be interested in that important branch of inquiry which relates to the several varieties of the human family’, discourses of human biological variety becoming increasingly prominent at the time in Europe, partly in relation to the disillusion and backlash following the abolition of slavery (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/18-boa-constrictor-and-alligator/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 18</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In speculating on the origins of these differences in physical appearance, Ellis concluded that ‘With regard to the Hovas, no doubt can be entertained that they are descended from the ancient race from which the Malayan Archipelago and Eastern Polynesia derive their inhabitants’. Interestingly, DNA research undertaken during the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century has tended to confirm these nineteenth century speculations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although initially presented and evaluated in phrenological as well as racial terms, Ellis also provided a description of the character of the man whose disembodied head he discussed in his book, stating:</p>\n<p>his disposition always appeared peculiarly gentle and benevolent. He usually wore the large white lamba, bordered with the <em>akotso</em>, or five broad stripes, the distinctive badge of the Hovas. The accompanying wood engraving is a faithful, but not particularly flattering, copy of the photograph of which I brought home a number of copies.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis states that he got to know this man when he came to ask for medical assistance for a family member who was ill, and had much to do with him at both the coast and the capital. The description of this meeting appears to match one given for his initial meeting with Rainitsontsoraka in a subsequent account, <em>Madagascar Revisited,</em> published in 1867.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Was the published portrait of a ‘Hova Chief’ an engraver’s interpretation of the rather washed out negative held at Wisbech, in which the man depicted also wears an <em>akotso</em>? Does the location of the placement of this image in the text suggest that Ellis first photographed Rainisontsoraka for the first time at Tamatave in 1854, and is its relatively poor quality suggestive of this?</p>\n<p>Another photograph at the Royal Ontario Museum appears to be a much better match for the image of the ’Hova Chief’, and a later account of Rainitsontsoraka’s life suggests he was probably being held in chains at the time for his participation in Christian meetings.</p>\n<p>On 4 September 1854, Ellis left Tamatave to travel to Mahavelona, known to Europeans as Foule Pointe, forty-five miles to the North. He was carried in a palanquin by four men, two others carrying his camera and photographic equipment with a third taking his camera stand and a small stool, and a fourth a carpet-bag with a tea-kettle and some crockery inside.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>During their stops to rest, Ellis photographed trees and plants using the calotype process, developing his negatives at night. Arriving at Foule Point, he spent the evening secretly meeting with local Christians who asked questions about religious belief and practice in England. Reflecting on the meeting, he noted ‘the deep and peculiar sympathy which we all seemed to feel’:</p>\n<p>We were inhabitants of different hemispheres, and belonged to communities widely separated from each other by their relative civilisation and social position; yet we met and conferred together with a degree of confidence, satisfaction, and even enjoyments, as entire and sincere as if we have been long united in the closest human fellowship; and we felt, that we cherished aspirations as identical as if we were ultimately to be gathered into one common home.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although Ellis was able to consider the racial identities and origins of his Malagasy friends, as well as to entertain fairly dubious phrenological theories concerning the shape of their heads, this did not prevent him from also ‘brothering’ them – asserting the essential similarity of human sympathies on which missionary activity was ultimately predicated.</p>\n<p>Indeed, he went on to suggest that ’sympathy so entire and uniform under all the diversities of external condition… can spring from only one source’, divine influence, arguing that in time ‘the estranged and separated members of the human family’ would ultimately be united ‘in one hallowed bond of brotherhood and peace’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although asked for a portrait by the Governor of Foule Point, his proved impossible due to heavy rain. Returning to Tamatave, Ellis left Madagascar on 14 September 1854_._ According to his own account, his cabin was so filled with boxes, baskets and bales of orchids that there was only enough room left for him to climb directly into the berth. On 20 December, he left Mauritius for the Cape, where he spent five months visiting LMS missions on behalf of the Directors.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Stopping at Salt Pans Drift in the Great Karoo in March 1855, on his way to Cradock (Nxuba), Ellis stayed with the Trollip family, descendants of English settlers to South Africa who arrived in 1820. In their house he found a ‘well-filled bookcase’ including <em>The Women of England</em>, ‘alongside several other equally familiar volumes by the same writer, which I had little expected to meet with in this remote part of Africa’. The writer, Sarah Stickney, was in fact William Ellis’s wife, the two having married in 1837 following the death of Ellis’ first wife, Mary Mercy Moor, in 1835.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sarah had published poetry and short stories under her own name in 1835, but became even more famous as ‘Mrs. Ellis’ when she published <em>The Women of England, their Social duties, and Domestic Habits</em> in 1839. She would play a significant role in shaping emerging notions of middle class respectable femininity, addressing her book not to ‘ladies’ but rather to ‘<em>women’</em> who ‘enjoy the privilege of liberal education, with exemption from the pecuniary necessities of labour’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Stickney herself supported the Ellis family by establishing a girl’s school in 1845, and while an advocate of women’s education, emphasised ‘the domestic character of England’. She argued this was ‘intimately associated with, and dependent upon, the moral feelings and habits of the women of this favoured country’. Arguing that ‘false notions of refinement’ were rendering the English women ‘less influential, less useful, and less happy than they were’ by leading ‘young ladies (for they are no longer <em>women</em>)’ into ‘a constant pining for excitement, and an eagerness to escape from everything like practical and individual duty’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The exemplary Mrs Ellis remained at home, upholding her own domestic duties during the two years her husband was in Madagascar and South Africa. He seems to have taken photographs of his home and family with him, but encountering books written and published while his wife adjusted to her new marital state undoubtedly reminded him of the home and family he had left behind.</p>\n<p>On his return to Cape Town, William Ellis met Kgosi Sechele I, leader of the Bakwena (people of the crocodile) in what is now Botswana. Sechele is remembered today as the only African to be converted by the young David Livingstone, at the time travelling through Central Africa. Ellis also received a letter from Madagascar, inviting him and Cameron to visit the capital. Having been away from home for over two years, he first returned to London in mid-June in the <em>Pacific</em>, a steam ship on its way to Britain from Australia, arriving in England on 18 July 1855.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When a second letter arrived from Madagascar later that year, Ellis decided to return to the island, leaving Southhampton on 20 March 1856, just as the southern hemisphere summer cooled. Rather than travelling via the Cape, however, he steamed through the Mediterranean to Alexandria, travelling overland to Suez three years before work began on the canal. There he boarded another steamer that would take him to Ceylon [Sri Lanka].<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Leaving Colombo on 24 May, he arrived at Mauritius on 17 June in the wake of another cholera outbreak. On 9 July he sailed for Madagascar in the <em>Castro</em>, the same ship he had left the islad in less than two years earlier. Ellis found Tamatave to have increased considerably in size in the meantime following the resumption of trade.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis met many old friends in Madagascar, including the family of a man whose portrait he made two years previously. They asked for copies of the photograph, their relative having died of smallpox in the interim. With the negative back in England, Ellis was only able to give one copy of the image to the man’s eldest son.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 17 July, an English speaking guide who had worked in the Cape for several years as a youth arrived to take them to the capital. As well as his photographic equipment, Ellis took a model electric telegraph that he hoped to demonstrate, in the expectation it would:</p>\n<p>heighten their sense of the amazing resources of civilised nations, and the many advantages to be derived from upright and amicable intercourse with them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>His visitors were evidently much impressed when told a cannon could be fired from miles away by means of a wire connected to a battery, but Ellis was disappointed to discover that a French Jesuit had already offered to establish a telegraph between Tamatave and the kingdom’s inland capital, Antananarivo.</p>\n<p>Ellis left Tamatave on 6 August 1856, four men carrying him in a palanquin. On the road they met ‘two chiefs’ who had seen the photographs Ellis had given to people two years earlier, and asked whether he intended to make more at the capital.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 26 August they arrived at Antananarivo where Ellis was provided with accommodation by the Queen. The following day he was visited by the twenty-six year old son of Queen Ranavalona and evident heir to the thrown, Prince Rakoto (later Radama II). He wore ‘a black dress-coat and pantaloons, gold embroidered velvet waistcoat, and white cravat’. Ellis showed him photographs of his house and family, back in England.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>They spoke about Queen Victoria, international affairs and the war with Russia in Crimea, as well as the British alliance with France. According to Ellis, the prince spoke of ‘the English having often interfered to protect the weak and the injured, and to prevent wrong’, but how much of this was a charitable interpretation, applied by Ellis forthe benefit of his English readers, is unclear.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Prince asked about the meaning of the term ‘protection’, probing rumours of a French plan to invade Madagascar. Ellis, in turn, asked whether rumours that he was a Roman Catholic were true. At this, the prince told him a Catholic priest had given him and his wife medallions to wear, telling them that if they put their confidence in the Virgin Mary they would have a child. Showing Ellis the medallion hanging around his neck, he added ‘it has not proved true: my wife has no child’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>For Ellis, the rivalry with French Catholics for the island presumably reminded him of Tahiti where he began his missionary career. Tahiti had been declared a French protectorate in 1842, although Huahine where Ellis also lived, remained independent, at least in 1856.</p>\n<p>Ellis received a visit from the family of a (Christian) friend who had died shortly after he left in 1854. Ellis took ‘a small likeness of my friend’ out of his portfolio and handed to his father, who looked at it and wept. His mother kissed the photograph, weeping silently, but profusely for several minutes. He then gave a full-length portrait to the man’s widow who also wept. After they all cried together, Ellis offered to give them one of the photographs, but they asked him to frame to better preserve their relative’s memory.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis was soon visited by an officer from the Royal Court to discusse the gifts he had brought. Although of interest to the officers, the electric telegraph had already been dismissed by the Queen. When they talked about photography, he told Ellis that the Queen and some of other people had the idea that ‘if their likenesses were taken they would soon die; that the likeness resembled the spirit of a person, and when that was gone said, “Why what is there left?”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis showed him photographs of people still living, noting that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had not only been photographed, but were the patrons of the photographic society in England. The officer declared ‘that it was only a superstitious idea, and said he should like to have his own likeness taken, and would show it to the queen’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 5 September 1856, Ellis was summoned to see Queen Ranavalona. When he put on his plain business suit, he was advised to wear the rich satin green and purple plaid dressing-gown with a scarlet lining he had brought as a gift. Presenting her with a gold sovereign as hasina, or tribute, he spoke to the queen about Madagascar’s relationship with England.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis had hesitated to use his camera at the capital, but when he received a note telling him Prince Rakoto wished to have his likeness taken, he attempted to set up a dark room, unpacking his camera and preparing the necessary chemicals. Constantly interrupted by visitors seeking medicine, he requested and was sent a table from the palace to use for his photography.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>He soon found, however, that he had no acetic acid to make a developing solution. Roger Fenton had helped him make a list of necessary items, but somehow Ellis omitted the acetic acid:</p>\n<p>My perplexity was great; and I am sure all photographers who have been in similar circumstances of destitution, in a country where there were no chemist’s shops, and no fellow-photographers of whom to borrow, will be able fully to sympathise with me.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As the Prince became increasingly impatient for his photograph, Ells attempted to experiment with alternatives to the missing acetic acid. Summoned to present his gifts to the Queen, he took engravings of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, as well as a colour print of Windsor Castle. Returning to his dark room to continue his experiments, he was called away to a dance, at which he regretted not having a camera to record the opulent costumes.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As the lowland fever season approached, Ellis asked the Queen whether he could stay at the capital all summer, extending his visit for a further nine months. He was told she expected him to leave in just over a week. Finally, on Saturday 20 September, Ellis managed to develop a good negative by adding ‘one third part of the vinegar to the ordinary pyrogallic mixture’ (chemically vinegar is acetic acid).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis could not begin making photographs immediately, the next day being Sunday and a day of rest.</p>\n<p>Ellis woke early on Monday 22 September, however, to set up some matting as a background for the photographs. Prince Rakoto arrived by 7am, and following an exposure time of one minute, Ellis was delighted when his mixture resulted in a ‘tolerably good negative’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The following morning, the prince returned to be photographed with his wife (whose swollen face the day before led her to avoid the camera), and they both joined Ellis in the dark room to witness the developing process. Ellis then offered to make a full-length portrait using a larger plate of glass, 15 by 12 inches, but had to set up a temporary stand to allow the princess to keep her head still while standing for a minute. This was followed by a joint portrait of the couple, which they watched developing in the dark room together:</p>\n<p>The distinctness of tones in the princess’s necklace, and the bouquet in her hand, with the strong relief of the star in the prince’s breast, and the book he held, caused them to marvel quite as much as the features of their countenances. They had moved very slightly, and the photograph was not so good as that of the single figures: but it was passable and afforded them great satisfaction.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Next, Ellis tried to photograph an officer, ‘who had come in a richly embroidered uniform’, but the sunlight in the middle of the day resulted in ‘a bad and burnt impression’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ellis suggests it was the following day that he attempted to make the full-length portrait of his ‘valued friend’, before members of the royal court arrived. Large numbers wanted to be photographed, it seems, just as his time in the capital was running out.</p>\n<p>On 26 September 1856, Ellis left Antananarivo for the coast.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the early morning on 25 September 1856, when he photographed his friend, William Ellis seems to have been pursuing an alternative agenda. Rather than simply photographing high-status royals, keen to use photography to immortalise themselves in all their imported finery, he wanted to make portraits of key members of the underground Christian Church. They largely remained largely nameless in the text he published in 1859, presumably at least partly to protect thei identities.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, in concluding <em>Three Visits to Madagascar</em>, Ellis connected the plight of Malagasy Christians to the persecution of Christians in earlier ages, suggesting that the authorities in Madagascar:</p>\n<p>Only imitated the Diocletians of the early ages, and the Alvas, the Medicis, and the Marys of more recent times, and with corresponding results in the invincible constancy of those who fell and the subsequent fruits of the imperishable seed which was scattered in the martyrs’ blood.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>News of the death of Queen Ranavalona, the ascension to the throne of Prince Rakoto as Radama II, and the end of the persecution of the Christians reached Britain in autumn 1861. Ellis made his way back to Madagascar in November 1861, arriving on 22 May 1862.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> During her husband’s third long-term absence, Sarah Stickney published her own work on the island, <em>Madagascar: Its Social and Religious Progress,</em> early in 1863.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> William Ellis would not return home until October 1865.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In <em>Madagascar Revisited</em>, published in 1867, William Ellis publicly named Rainitsontsoraka for the first time. A full page portrait was printed in the book, with the caption ‘Rainitsontsoraka. Christian Martyr’. The engraving appears to have been based on a photograph now at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, which has the same description written on the back.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Also at the ROM in Toronto, a full-length photograph of a man wearing a dark striped lamba appears to match the photograph Ellis described making early in the morning on 25 September 1856. A version of this had featured in <em>Three Visits to Madagascar,</em> where it formed part of a composite image where it was labelled ‘Hova Officer in Silk Lamba’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When the same printing plate was re-used in <em>The Martyr Church</em>, published in 1870, Ellis noted that the two officers shown on the right of the image had been persecuted as Christians. They had sought refuge at Tamatave and Mahavelona (Foule Point), where it seems Ellis met many members of the Christian community during his initial visits in 1853 and 1854.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In <em>Madagascar Revisited</em>, published in 1867, Ellis explained that Rainitsontsoraka had ‘been among the little band who gathered in my inner room in the concealment of night’ to worship, and was:</p>\n<p>my daily and most pleasant companion during my first visit to Antananarivo, and who was one of the distinguished witnesses for Christ who suffered in this last and severest ordeal.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>He would be the person Ellis gave his remaining medicine and medical book when he left Antananarivo in 1856.</p>\n<p>On 21 May 1857, two months before he died, Rainitsonsoraka wrote an account of his life and that of his brother, Rainimanga, which he sent to David Johns Andrianado, a Malagasy Evangelist, who sent it to Ellis. The brothers had lost their father as children, so ‘had to work at making spades’. In 1834 they became cultivators of the soil, and in 1836 attendants for Rainimaharo, one of Queen Ranavalona’s ministers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Together the brothers made a ‘foreign violin’ which they showed to Rainimaharo, who showed it to the Queen. Since foreign things had been forbidden, the officers were fined, but the brothers were incorporated into the court as skilled makers. In 1839, when the Queen began building her palace, a crane carrying the timbers failed, and Rainitsontsoraka designed a toothed crane to complete the work. He built a model which was shown to the Queen, who ordered a full size version from the royal blacksmiths.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the same year, when Laborde, a French trader demanded a thousand dollars for a fire engine, Rainimaharo asked the two brothers to copy the design. Despite their usefulness to the court, they were reported for attending a Christian meeting and arrested in 1845. Their wives and children were sold, together with all their belongings, but the two brothers were purchased by Prince Rakoto, who determined they should not be sold again.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Named as worshipping Christians once more, they were imprisoned for two years and then bound with other Christians in heavy metal fetters.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn101\" id=\"fnref101\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">101</a></sup> While bound in this way, Rainitsontsoraka learnt about European medicine from a book, and began to treat the sick.</p>\n<p>In 1855, the fetters were removed from the two brothers, shortly before Ellis visited Antananarivo. At the end of the account of his life, Rainitsontsoraka declared:</p>\n<p>This is the state of the work of the Lord with me, which I made known unto you, beloved brother; and all the friends here visit you. May you live, and have happiness, saith RAINITSONTSORAKA and his brother.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It seems clear to me at least that the man in the photograph wearing the striped lamba is the same as the one in the photograph with ‘Native Christian Pastor’ written on the back. It is less clear that this man is the one in the photograph labelled ‘Rainitsontsoraka’. Is it possible that the man in the brown silk lamba was in fact not Rainitsontsoraka but rather Rainimanga, his brother who was also a Christian?</p>\n<p>Converting the surviving negative at Wisbech into a positive image, this looks to me like another man altogether. Did Ellis incorrectly label this, failing to recognise his friend’s face in the negative image? Or was the error made in 1874 when an index was compiled for the prints made by Samuel Smith, after Ellis had died?</p>\n<p>In some ways, we can regard these photographs from Madagascar as an extension of the many portraits of faithful Christian individuals which had appeared at the front of the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> for over half a century_._  As photographs, however, they encourage us to look deeper into the faces of their subjects, chemically preserved for posterity, treating these images as proxies for their identities as individuals, even after death – possibly even as indexes of their very souls.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>I am very grateful to Robert Bell for providing me with access to the Ellis material at the Wisbech and Fenland Museum.

It was Amelia who made it clear just how important photographs of distant family members were in missionary homes, inspiring my engagement with the photograph featuring Sarah Stickney in this chapter.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div><section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ellis, W. 1859. <em>Three Visits to Madagascar, during the years 1853-1854-1856.</em> London, John Murray, p. 416: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nPoGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA416#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nPoGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA416#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ellis, W. 1859. <em>Three Visits to Madagascar, during the years 1853-1854-1856.</em> London, John Murray, p. 416: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nPoGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA416#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nPoGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA416#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ellis, W. 1867. <em>Madagascar Revisited, describing the events of a new reign and the revolution which followed.</em> London, John Murray, p. 66: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yR8UAAAAIAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=madagascar%20revisited&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yR8UAAAAIAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=madagascar revisited&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Wisbech and Fenland Museum, Minutes of the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 1873. <a href=\"#fnref4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Wisbech and Fenland Museum, Committee Minutes, 6 April 1874. <a href=\"#fnref5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn6\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Photographs from Negatives taken in Madagascar by the late Revd.

Marked above the head of the club is a measurement, two and a half inches, presumably the diameter, while the length of the club is written along its side, 2ft 10in. Next to the bottom of the club is an enlarged oval, evidently depicting a pattern carved into the base.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As well as these sketches and the accompanying measurements are three words, written in pencil: ‘Missions’, ‘Erromango.’, and ‘No. 725’. There is also what appears to be an abbreviated inscription, possibly in shorthand. The page forms part of two sequences in the notebook which have the word ‘Missions’ written at the top of each page.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> A number of these pages feature sketches of familiar artefacts from the collections of the London Missionary Society, including an apron of iron beads (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mantatese-apron/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 8</a>) and a quadrangular club from South America (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/pehi/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 5</a>).</p>\n<p>Many of the sketches also have a number written alongside, which connects them to a catalogue of items displayed at the Paris <em>Exposition Universelle</em> of 1867, in a section dedicated to Protestant evangelical missions. Looking up ‘No. 725’, I discovered the following description in French:</p>\n<p><em>725. Massue avec laquelle fut massacré le révérend J. Williams, missionaire</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Rather than any old club, this was the weapon with which John Williams, the celebrated ‘Apostle to Polynesia’ was martyred on 20 November 1839, after he landed on the island of Erromango (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/15-the-departure-of-the-camden/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 15</a>). Why was its particular historical significance not recorded in the notebook alongside the sketch?</p>\n<p>The notebook forms part of a series referred to as the ‘Franks Notebooks’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Augustus Wollaston Franks was a key figure at the British Museum during the second half of the nineteenth century, originally appointed as an assistant in the Department of Antiquities in 1851. Franks had been educated at Eton College and Trinity College in Cambridge, where he was an early member of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society, established in 1840. Working with the collections of the Royal Archaeological Institute, established in 1844, Franks had curated an exhibition of medieval art at the Society of Arts in 1850.</p>\n<p>The initial enthusiasms of Franks were predominantly Medieval, connecting him to the romantic idealisation of the period which arose in response to Britain’s rapid industrialisation during mid-nineteenth century. Key events included the publication of <em>Contrasts</em> by Augustus Pugin in 1836, which sought for ‘a return to the faith and social structures of the Middle Ages’, the reception into the Catholic Church of the prominent Anglican priest, John Henry Newman in 1845, as well as the establishment of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood of artists in 1848.</p>\n<p>Martin J. Wiener, who regarded the 1851 Great Exhibition at London as the high-water mark of British industrial values, nevertheless pointed out that:</p>\n<p>Planted within the Great Exhibition itself was a core of cultural opposition, represented by Augustus Pugin’s Medieval Court. A sharper contrast could hardly be imagined than that between Pugin’s Gothic furnishings and their iron-and-glass enclosure; yet they too were an expression of the period.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>For Weiner, the period after 1851 saw a gradual blurring of these battle lines through a process of mutual accommodation. The story by which the name of an enthusiastic medievalist, Franks, came to be associated with a notebook of drawings of items associated with overseas missionary activity illustrates certain strands in the shifting networks that surrounded museums during this period.</p>\n<p>In fact, the drawing of the Erromangan club seems not to have been produced by Franks, but rather by his assistant Thomas Gay. Gay had previously worked for the Quaker industrialist Henry Christy, whose family firm exhibited the first industrially produced loop pile towelling at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London, inspired by towels he had encountered during his travels to the Eastern Mediterranean the previous year.</p>\n<p>Christy visited Scandinavia in 1852 and 1853 where he met the influential Danish archaeologist and curator, Christian Jürgensen Thomsen. Appointed by the Danish Royal Commission in 1816, Thomsen had pioneered a series of archaeological techniques such as seriation through his arrangements of finds from prehistoric graves, ultimately establishing archaeology’s three age system. By sequencing grave goods from a range of locations, Thomsen was able to show that stone followed bronze and bronze followed iron as the materials from which the main tools and weapons had been made, at least in Denmark’s prehistoric past.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Thomsen’s <em>Guideline to Nordic Antiquity</em> was published in English in 1848, followed by his successor J.J. Worsaae’s <em>The Primeval Antiquities of Denmark</em> in 1849, stimulating the growing British interest in northern Europe’s prehistoric past. For some, this fed into what has been called ‘Teutomania’, an enthusiasm for all things Northern and Germanic (such as Gothic architecture), which even extended to attempting to purify English of non-Germanic words. The word ‘folklore’ was coined in 1846 as ‘a good Saxon compound’ by William Thoms, an admirer of Jacob Grimm’s (1835) <em>Deutsche Mythologie</em> and the translator of Worsaae’s <em>Primeval Antiquities of Denmark</em> into English.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Henry Christy’s engagement with Danish archaeological work seems to have grown out of his involvement with the Aborigines Protection Society and, following its establishment in 1843, the Ethnological Society of London. Like Thomas Hodgkin, an Ethnological Society founder and fellow Quaker, Christy remained a member of both societies. A central problem faced by British Ethnology as it developed following the successful campaign to abolish slavery across the British Empire, was how to explain the obvious, observable and ongoing differences between people in different parts of the world, while retaining a commitment to underlying common origins and common humanity, a problem given sharp focus in the aftermath of slavery in the Caribbean (Chapter 18).</p>\n<p>In 1856 Henry Christy travelled to Cuba, Mexico and America, where he met another Quaker ethnologist, E.B. Tylor, whose account of their journey, <em>Anahuac, or Mexico and the Mexicans,</em> was published in 1861. Christy became increasingly interested in the European Stone Age, suggesting that many ancient artefacts could be better understood through comparison with similar artefacts still made in other parts of the world. Working with the French palaeontologist Edouard Lartet from 1863 onwards, he established excavations at caves in the Dordogne region of southern France. During a visit to caves in Belgium in April 1865, Christy became ill, passing away on 4 May 1865.</p>\n<p>It was Christy’s death which ultimately enabled an important accommodation between the ethnological enthusiasms of Quaker industrialists like Christy, with roots in the evangelical anti-slavery movement, and the medievalism that motivated members of the Anglican establishment like Franks. When The British Museum had reopened following the creation of its neo-classical portico in 1846, the “Ethnographical room” containing British and Medieval antiquities alongside material from other parts of the world was described as ‘a disgraceful jumble of things’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By 1850, when archaeological enthusiasms were rising among the British middle classes, partly as a result of discoveries during the construction of the railways, complaints were made that British antiquities could only be seen in a room ‘filled with clubs from the South Seas, and trifling objects from China and elsewhere’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Such collections, whether from Britain or other parts of the world, were resisted at the British Museum as essentially ‘uncivilised’, where the more monumental remains from what were regarded as ‘Ancient Civilizations’ were given pride of place. Even after Franks was appointed in 1851, British and Medieval Antiquities remained a fairly minor section of the Department of Antiquities, where classical works remained the major focus. In 1857, Anthony Panizzi, principal librarian (Director) of the museum between 1856 and 1866, complained to the museum’s trustees about ‘medieval antiquities, by what are called British or Irish antiquities, and by the ethnological collection’ suggesting that:</p>\n<p>It does not seem right that such valuable space should be taken up by Esquimaix dresses, canoes and hideous feather idols, broken flints, called rude knives, and so on…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Franks became disillusioned when he was passed over for Keeper in 1860, when the Antiquities department was split into three new departments (Greek and Roman Antiquities, Oriental Antiquities &amp; Coins and Medals), with his own area (Medieval and British Antiquities and Ethnography) becoming a sub-Department of Oriental Antiquities. A month after Christy died, in June 1865 he expressed a desire to resign, but in a subsequent <em>Apology</em> of his his life, stated:</p>\n<p>When Mr Christy told me that he had appointed me a trustee he said that if I wished the main collection to go to the Museum I must fight for it.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By 3 July 1865, Franks was planning to visit Christy’s collections in Paris. Together with Christy’s other trustees, John Lubbock, Joseph Hooker (Director of Kew Gardens) and Daniel Hanbury (a Quaker), Franks offered Christy’s collections to The British Museum ‘provided that the Trustees would undertake to find proper space’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The collections were associated with a financial settlement of £5000, enabling the trustees to continue to pay the annual rent for Christy’s home in London which housed the majority of the collection, as well as to offer the trustees £100 a year for five years.</p>\n<p>In a letter to Lubbock in early July 1865, Franks suggested:</p>\n<p>If we play our cards right this collection may be the means of getting the Ethnological Collns put on a more satisfactory footing at the Museum… Panizzi is about to retire &amp; many changes may take place which may lead to an improvement in those portions of the collection in which you &amp; I take interest.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 18 November 1865, the trustees accepted the offer, although the Christy collections ultimately remained at 103 Victoria Street, where Thomas Gay continued to live, for some time. Franks argued that:</p>\n<p>Ethnography has assumed such a totally different aspect within the last few years; its scientific and historical value has been so fully recognised, that I feel sure that, whether the natural history collections shall be retained at the Museum or not, it will be thought desirable to keep here collections which, when properly arranged, will be highly attractive and popular.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In May 1866, Franks was appointed Keeper of a new Department of British and Medieval Antiquities and Ethnography, suggesting privately it might have been called the ‘Department of Miscellaneous Antiquities’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> It was from this newly empowered position that Franks traveled to Paris for the <em>Exposition Universelle</em> the following summer, accompanied by Thomas Gay, the assistant he inherited from Christy along with the collection.</p>\n<p>Presumably one reason the club from Erromanga’s status as a missionary ‘relic’ was not recorded was that it was assessed primarily in terms of its scientific value, in relation to the emerging field of Anthropology. This brought together ‘ethnography’, items from the non-European world, with archaeological discoveries from Europe in order to forge a new understanding of human history, extending back to its earliest beginnings. The fate of the missionary John Williams, less than three decades earlier, was far from a central concern to those attempting to rewrite the entire history of civilisation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It might seem that these mid-century scientific preoccupations had little to do with the London Missionary Society, beyond shared connections with the anti-slavery and humanitarian movements. The overlapping membership of people like William Ellis (Chapter 19), however, meant that the Missionary Museum was also reshaped in the decade after the 1851 Great Exhibition, partly in response to such developments at other museums. On 25 June 1859, an article in the <em>Illustrated London News</em> announced that the Missionary Museum:</p>\n<p>has recently been rearranged in a most careful and intelligent manner by a son of the late Reverend John Williams, who was so barbarously murdered….These objects are now carefully labelled, so that we can pass along with both pleasure and instruction.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>An accompanying image of the museum’s interior shows the same interior space lit by skylights that was depicted in images from 1843, 1847 and 1853, but now without the presiding giraffe (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a>). Only the ‘Gigantic Idol’ from Rarotonga (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>) still reaches up towards the light, although a number of other recognisable artefacts, including <em>Paramasattee</em> (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/14-paramasattee/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 14</a>),  are located around a table at the centre of the room where a visiting family inspects them with interest.</p>\n<p>The majority of items on display in the museum are held within the glass-fronted cases that line the perimeter walls, although a number of items are stored above these as well as in the space below. While an image of the museum from 1853 suggests the walls above the cases had long been used for storing long weapons, these are now artfully arranged into fans, emulating the form of the classical trophy (Chapter 26), a mode of display widely used at the 1851 Great Exhibition, even for displays of industrial produce .</p>\n<p>What is most clear from the image is that, apart from one case, all the Natural History specimens have been removed from the main room along with the giraffe. Neither the pelican or vulture which had long perched atop the projecting cases, sent from Corfu by Isaac Lowndes LMS missionary there between 1822 to 1844, nor the rhinoceros horn which stood on its own plinth for decades, since John Campbell displayed it as a ‘unicorn’s horn’ on his return from Africa, are evident anywhere in the image.</p>\n<p>A second surviving catalogue of the Missionary Museum, although undated, appears to approximately match this arrangement of the museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> While the ‘Advertisement’ at the front of the catalogue describes the museum’s contents in terms that are unchanged from the 1826 catalogue (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/11-virgin-mary-and-child-from-mysore/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 11</a>), as ‘natural productions of… distant countries’, ‘efforts… of natural genius, especially in countries rude and uncivilised’, and ‘<em>horrible</em> IDOLS’, a note inserted on the opposite page makes another, more scientific, distinction – between ‘HISTORY and NATURAL HISTORY’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While artefacts relating to ‘HISTORY’ had coloured labels that showed the region of the world from which they came, ‘Miscellaneous Articles and Natural History’ were given white labels and located only in case B and the lobby. The order of the catalogue reflects the reduced significance of these items, beginning with ‘IDOLS AND OBJECTS OF SUPERSTITIOUS REGARD FROM ISLANDS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN’, and ending with ‘MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES UNCONNECTED WITH THE MISSIONS’ and finally ‘NATURAL HISTORY’.</p>\n<p>A series of images and descriptions of individual museum cases appeared in the <em>Juvenile Missionary Magazine</em> from January 1860 onwards_._ Beginning, like the museum catalogue, with case A, filled with ‘South Sea Idols’, the text establishes a clear contrast between the Missionary Museum and other museums:</p>\n<p>Now this museum is altogether different from every other museum in the world. It is not a mere collection of curious, or beautiful, or valuable things, such as you will find in The British Museum, and many other museums in London and the country; nor is it intended merely to amuse, or please, or even to instruct those who visit it…</p>\n<p>The chief purpose of the Missionary Museum is to show what men are without the Gospel. It therefore contains many objects of heathen worship, and many instruments of heathen cruelty. And these objects if they are rightly considered, will teach us many things which we ought both to know and to feel… what evidence do they give of the power which Sin and Satan have in the world! what proof of the darkness, degradation, folly, and misery of the heathen, and of the wonderful difference which the Gospel has made between our state and theirs!</p>\n<p>And surely such a site should call forth our pity and our prayers on their behalf, and should make us very glad, not only that we were born in a Christian land, but also in a day when many servants of God are to be found amongst the heathen, and when, as the rejected gods in this museum show, multitudes of them have been turned from dumb idols to worship the blessed Jehovah.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The museum located its visitors in a time and space – when British Christianity had been empowered to fight back against the power of Sin and Satan, as evidenced by what were described as ‘rejected idols, or “dead gods,” as some of them were called when they sent home by their former worshippers’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Here we may be able to detect the voice of the son of John Williams’ son, who surely remembered some of the occasions when items were handed over to mark the conversion of Pacific islands (Chapter 12).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The accompanying woodcut image was described as showing a case ‘on the north side of the museum, at the left hand as you enter the door’, and this matches what can be seen of the case on the immediate left of the image published in the Illustrated London News just over six months earlier. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The article about the museum in the February issue of the <em>Juvenile Missionary Magazine</em> did not include an image, but continued describing figures from case A.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> When another image appeared in April 1860, it showed the third case from the left.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> At the centre of the image is a model of the missionary ship, <em>John Williams</em>, the operating costs of which had been funded by the collections from juvenile supporters since its launch in 1844, when the <em>Juvenile Missionary Magazine</em> itself was also established.</p>\n<p>Arrayed around the ship were a series of artefacts which, according to the article, showed ‘the Polynesians… were very ignorant and very cruel before they received the Gospel. But some of the curious things in this case equally show that they were very clever.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> As an example, tattoos were explained as a form of dressing the body regarded as ‘the very perfection of beauty’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Attention was then drawn to ‘a very plain-looking club… hanging down in the middle of the case’ which juvenile readers were informed was:</p>\n<p>the club which killed John Williams at Erromanga. As you have read the sad story of his death, both in this Magazine and elsewhere, we shall not repeat it here. Neither need we say more than that the savage chief to whom this club belonged, and who felled the noble servant of Christ to the ground, gave up the deadly weapon to a Missionary who went to Erromanga in your ship, and now this wretched man sees how foolish and how wicked a thing he did.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The emerging mythology of the mission, and particularly that of its children’s section, focused on fundraising to sustain a ship bearing John Williams’ name, made it unnecessary to repeat the story of his life and death. The image of the case, however, with the club suspended at its centre, demonstrates the way in which John Williams’ martyrdom became central to the narration of LMS efforts in the decades following his death.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In May 1860, the Juvenile Missionary Magazine included an image of the only case retaining Natural History in the main part of the museum. Readers were told it had ‘no idols in it – no spears, nor clubs, nor curious things made by uncivilised peoples’:</p>\n<p>But there are objects which catch the eye of every visitor, and which are sure to draw the young to the case almost as soon as they enter the Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The first item described was the ‘large serpent coiled round an alligator’ from Demerara (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/18-boa-constrictor-and-alligator/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 18</a>), while above that was the ‘great boa constrictor coiled round the trunk of the tree’. While the story of its capture at Kristnapore was provided, readers were also told:</p>\n<p>Now, this is not put in the Museum as a natural curiosity merely.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although not explicitly stated, given the declared function of the museum to ‘show what men are without the Gospel’, the serpent wrapped around a tree at its centre was surely intended as a reminder of ‘the power which Sin and Satan have in the world!’ by evoking the story of Adam and Eve’s temptation in the Garden of Eden from the Book of Genesis.</p>\n<p>Subsequent articles described cases of accumulated ‘idols and objects of superstition from India’ as well as ‘Buddhist and other Idols’ from the South Side of the Museum. When the series ended in April 1861, readers were encouraged to visit the museum, to:</p>\n<p>examine most carefully the cases on the east side, facing them as they enter. Most of the articles in these cases are labelled, and they clearly show how clever and yet how foolish the people are who make them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As an example, the case of items from China were described, including a mariner’s compass, porcelain, and ‘books printed when the inhabitants of Europe were ignorant of this important art’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Alongside these ‘proofs of the skill of this wonderful nation’, however, were miniature shoes worn by ‘Chinese ladies’ following foot binding, as well as opium paraphernalia associated with ‘death’ and ‘disease’ for ‘the wretched multitudes who use it’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Near these examples of ‘Chinese skill, and folly’ was a copy of the Bible, translated by Dr Morrison (Chapter 9), displayed as ‘the Book which can alone make men wise unto salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The article ended the series by noting that while many juvenile supporters might not be able to visit the Society’s far flung missions, they could more easily visit the museum at Blomfield Street in London, where:</p>\n<p>The instruments of cruelty, the weapons of war, and the horrid idols once feared and worshipped, are themselves proofs that old things have passed away, as most of these are relics and trophies – tokens that the wicked customs and abominable idolatries of former days have been abandoned. Here, then, before our eyes, you may see what God hath wrought.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Children reading the magazine were informed, in no uncertain terms, that the correct response to ‘some of the most curious and interesting objects ever exhibited’ was ‘more prayer and zeal for the world’s salvation than ever’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Given the central role allocated to the club that killed John Williams in this recently reimagined museum, how did it come to be removed from display and sent to Paris a mere six years later?</p>\n<p>In December 1866, the <em>Missionary Magazine and Chronicle</em> reported that representatives of several British Missionary Societies accepted an invitation to participate in the 1867 exhibition. It was reported that ‘various Continental Societies’ saw the exhibition for ‘showing what Protestantism is doing for the conversion of heathen nations’, since in Roman Catholic countries, and specially in France:</p>\n<p>the Romish priest are accustomed to tell their people that Protestantism is a dead system; that it has no power of expansion; that it cares nothing for humanity; and that it has no Missions among barbarous nations!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was proposed that the exhibition would be ‘powerfully and practially’ answer these calumnies.</p>\n<p>While the Directors of the LMS felt that ‘the highest and most enduring fruits of missionary labours are spiritual, and that the gathering if Churches, the moral elevation of tribes and nations, and their social improvement are incapable of exhibition’, they nevertheless agreed that ‘some important uses may be served by the scheme’, so agreed to contribute. Concerned that the associated costs should not come from the general funds of the Society, they appealed for ‘Special Contributions’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>​On 6 January 1867, Theodor Vernes wrote from Paris to the Joseph Mullens, recently appointed Foreign Secretary of the London Missionary Society (LMS) after two decades as a missionary in India. Following a visit he had personally made to London, Vernes confirmed the rationale for establishing a missionary museum at the 1867 <em>Exposition Universelle</em>:</p>\n<p>to render by the most practical means what was the state of the inhabitants of the different Missionary stations, in reference to their manners and their belief, and what has become their moral and religious state since the influence of the Christian religion has been disseminated among them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The exhibition would include ‘idols, models, engravings, maps, specimens of objects showing the rude state of industry, costumes, arms and weapons, implements of all kinds, books and newspapers published by the natives’, as well as ‘works published in Europe and America, which are in use by the natives of the various stations’. Items should be sent to Paris by 15 January, to be received there by the 15<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> February, with French railway companies offering a 50% reduction in tariffs for the transport of exhibition material.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In March 1867, <em>the Chronicle</em> reported that twenty cases had arrive in Paris, where they were to be arranged the Rev. T. Powell, a missionary in Samoa, as well as the Rev. Samuel Williams (the ordained son of John Williams).  It was pointed out that the costs of participating in the exhibition would come to ££180, and that donations had only been received of £32 in support of the exhibition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although Vernes noted that the space provisionally allocated for the LMS was 40 feet long and 8 feet high, he urged Mullens to ‘send as many objects as you can, in order that our museum may be as rich and complete as possible’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Mullens seems to have taken Vernes at his word — the catalogue of the ‘S_ection des Missions Protestantes Évangéliques_’ lists 620 items in the section devoted to the LMS (246 from Asia, 214 from the Pacific, 155 from Africa and 5 from the Americas), as well as several pages of unnumbered print publications.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This represents around a third of the collection at the LMS museum in London, at least when compared to the catalogue published less than a decade earlier.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The LMS sent twice as many items as any other missionary society to Paris and were associated with over 40% of the numbered entries in the catalogue. It is perhaps significant that the next highest contributions also came from missionary societies also headquartered in England, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (which sent 263 items), and the Anglican Church Missionary Society (which sent 210 items). These were followed by the Paris Evangelical Society (with 180 items), as well as the Netherlands Missionary Society (89 items), the Free Church of Scotland Missionary Society (80 items), Unitas Fratrum (the Moravians – 30 items), the Basel Mission (17 items) and the American Episcopal Church Mission (16 items). Other, un-numbered items from Hawai’i were also described in the catalogue alongside publications sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.</p>\n<p>Other organisations which exhibited print publications included the (British) Baptist Missionary Society, the Danish Missionary Society, the Sunday School Society, the British and Foreign Bible Society, the Bible Society of France, the Religious Tract Societies of London, New York and Paris, as well as the London Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Among the Jews. With sections devoted to each of these organisations, presumably mirroring the exhibition itself, the catalogue provides a snapshot of international Protestant evangelical activity in 1867, at least as it related to organisations sufficiently connected to international networks to feel they needed to be represented at Paris.</p>\n<p>While certainly international, the range of organisations reflects a particular network that connects Protestants from the Northeast of Europe (Paris, Denmark, the Netherlands and particularly the British Isles) to similar denominations in the United States of America. Significantly, despite roots in what is now Germany, the address listed for the Moravians in the catalogue is for their Mission House in London, rather than at Herrnhut. While the Moravians influenced the establishment of missionary societies in Britain at the end of the eighteenth century, the majority of other organisations represented at Paris, with the exception of the Sunday School Society (established in 1785), were established in the three decades after 1792:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1792 Baptist Missionary Society (BMS)</li>\n<li>1795 London Missionary Society (LMS)</li>\n<li>1797 Netherlands Missionary Society (NMS)</li>\n<li>1799 Church Missionary Society (CMS)</li>\n<li>1799 Religious Tract Society</li>\n<li>1804 British and Foreign Bible Society</li>\n<li>1809 London Society for Promoting Christianity Among the Jews</li>\n<li>1810 American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM)</li>\n<li>1812 New York Tract Society</li>\n<li>1815 Basel Mission (originally the German Missionary Society)</li>\n<li>1818 Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society (WMMS)</li>\n<li>1818 Protestant Bible Society of Paris</li>\n<li>1820 Paris Tract Society</li>\n<li>1821 Danish Missionary Society</li>\n<li>1821 Protestant Episcopal Church Mission (American Church Mission)</li>\n<li>1822 Paris Evangelical Missionary Society (PEM)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although the Free Church of Scotland Missionary Society was only established following the establishment of the Free Church itself in 1843, its origins lay in the overseas missions of the Edinburgh Missionary Society and Glasgow Missionary Society, both established in 1796, with resurgences of activity during the 1820s. It was therefore only the Basel Mission, safely located in Switzerland away from the most significant consequences of the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, which represented the German-speaking world at Paris, even though there were long-standing connections between the LMS, the Paris Evangelical Society and the Rhenish and Berlin Missionary Societies.Apart from the Netherlands Missionary Society, the establishment of which was connected to the commencement of the London Missionary Society’s work in South Africa (Chapter 2), all the societies established before 1810 were British. This suggests that the revival of Protestant missionary activity at the turn of the century had quite specific originating conditions.</p>\n<p>This is no less true of associated collecting practices, and it was the establishment of a museum by the LMS in 1814 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a>) which seems to have cemented an association between missionary activity and collecting. Despite the exhibition being held in Paris, it is striking that approximately 80% of the material on display was provided by British Missionary Societies, with only 19% from societies in continental Europe (Paris, Basel &amp; Netherlands), and only 1% from America.</p>\n<p>When William Ellis sent a parcel of ‘curiosities from different parts of the world’ to the new Missionary training college at Barmen in 1834 (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/13-all-wrapped-up-in-a-piece-of-tahitian-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 13</a>), he suggested they would be useful ‘in conveying a more lively impression of the actual degradation of the heathen and the polluting character of idol worship; and also of shewing what Missionaries had been able to effect in promoting the knowledge of the True God and the Only Saviour’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> It is striking that a similarly twinned formulation was used by Theodor Vernes when he wrote to Joseph Mullens about the Paris exhibition in January 1867.</p>\n<p>Another parallel between these two events is that when William Ellis listed the items he sent to Wuppertal, he produced two distinct lists. The first included objects collected in Africa, Oceania and Asia, the second listed printed texts, many of which were the result of missionary translation. In the printed catalogue of the 1867 exhibition we also see printed texts frequently treated differently to other artefacts. Three-dimensional artefacts appear to have been associated with what Vernes called ‘the state of the inhabitants of the different Missionary stations, in reference to their manners and their belief’, while printed texts were emblematic of ‘what has become their moral and religious state since the influence of the Christian religion has been disseminated among them’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This, I hope to suggest, marks this mode of exhibition as distinctively Protestant. European Protestants, associated their own history with Reformation struggles to access religious texts in vernacular languages, and understood the arrival of the printing press as providing the necessary conditions for their production and circulation. In Britain, William Tyndale, the first person to print a translation of the New Testament in English, in 1525, became a nationally celebrated Protestant martyr after he was burned at the stake in October 1536. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Protestant evangelical activity remained closely connected to the production of printed texts. A large part of the Protestant missionary project involved the conversion of vernacular languages into written form, in order to translate the Bible, but another of its dimensions was the development of a body of readers for these texts through the establishment of mission schools. A consequence was that readers soon became writers, generating their own texts that were printed in missionary run newspapers and periodicals, or religious tracts, many of which were displayed at Paris in 1867.</p>\n<p>Webb Keane has emphasised that Protestant missionary activity was often associated with a moral narrative emphasising the emancipation of converts, often from the twin holds of materiality (ie. ‘idols’) and inherited ancestral practices. Printed texts (and particularly biblical texts) appear to have regarded as unlike other material forms.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Rather than being regarded as forms of mediation equivalent to liturgical statues or paintings, or inherited ancestral wisdom as might be found in rituals, printed texts were treated as transparent embodiments of the word (and sometimes the Word of God).</p>\n<p>In his introduction to the published catalogue, Theodor Vernes emphasised that ‘these objects have almost no intrinsic value: the ideas they represent make their value’. Rather, he suggested that ‘We seek to extract the social and humanitarian from the material itself’, in order to ‘draw the interest of a crowd of visitors from all nations towards these great works of Christian conversion and civilisation’:</p>\n<p>Indeed, how could we glance at these thousands of objects, monotonous in their savage variety, or at these strangely shaped idols, sometimes repulsive, without being struck by the miserable intellectual state, by the barbarity and the feeblemindedness of the nations that adored them and offered them human sacrifices nearly everywhere? By contrast, if one considers the books, the newspapers and the various publications from these same indigenous people, barbarians or savages not so long ago, how can we not admire the power of the Gospel which has wonderfully transformed them?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Vernes suggested that the Sotho people of Southern Africa, among whom the Paris Evangelical Society had long worked, had been cannibals less than twenty years earlier, presumably basing this on accounts of starving ‘Mantatees’ during the difaqane (Chapter 8). He then noted that alongside the warrior’s costumes on display was a journal, ‘the Little Light… partly the work of natives’, which provided ‘undeniable evidence of the radical change in their mores and their religion, thanks to the efforts of our brave French missionaries’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Vernes paused to note the many missionaries who had paid for their lives for these societal transformations, noting that their martyrdom was made visible through some of the objects on display, in particular ‘the formidable weapon used by a native from one of the South Seas Islands to massacre the famous John Williams’. Williams was described as a ‘noble confessor of the Christian faith’ who ‘fell under the blows of those for whom he dedicated his existence’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> One of the only items individually referenced in the introduction, the club was evidently far from the straightforward ethnological specimen it was subsequently appraised as by Thomas Gay.</p>\n<p>While Vernes’ introduction described the various organisations represented in the Mission pavilion, including the British and Foreign Bible Society which exhibited copies of the Bible in 174 languages, it ended by shifting its focus from ‘démonstrations par les yeux’ to the ‘démonstration par la parole’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The Evangelical room, positioned at the centre of the pavilion, was intended as a ‘modest and calm centre of evangelisation’ where Protestants of various nationalities could worship while in Paris. There meetings of religious and philanthropic societies could be held, which would, Vernes hoped, ‘proclaim in everyone’s full view the unity of the Church of Jesus Christ’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While printed words could be displayed alongside ‘idols’, weapons, and other objects of non-Christian life, it was the spoken word that was presented as central to Protestant religious practice. Material things, even when they served to communicate the Word of God, remained distinctly secondary and potentially dangerous. Vernes ended his text by declaring:</p>\n<p>The dazzled man, captivated by the wonderful riches of the Exhibition, and tempted to glorify himself, may remember here that all the splendours of the magnificence and all the grandeur of the world are only a small glimmer of the greatness of God!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although essentially dismissed by Vernes as ‘monotonous’ and ‘sometimes repulsive’ evidence of pre-Christian life , how far did the items displayed at Paris reflect the particular histories of Protestant missionary societies over the previous half-century? When considered according to the continent from which they originated, the largest number of objects came from Asia (599), accounting for nearly 40% of the total. Every society listing material, except the Paris Evangelical Society, included Asian material. Over half this came from South Asia (341 items), presumably reflecting British dominance in the region — all the material displayed by the Netherlands Missionary Society came from Indonesia, a Dutch colonial possession. Of the 154 items from East Asia (mostly from China with a few items from Japan), 106 came from the London Missionary Society, 18 came from the Wesleyan Missionary Society and 15 each from the Church Missionary Society and the American Protestant Episcopal Mission.</p>\n<p>The next largest number of objects came from Africa (409), representing 27% of the total, with the largest contribution again made by the London Missionary Society (155 items), followed by the Paris Evangelical Society (119 items), reflecting the long-term engagements of both societies in southern Africa. While the Wesleyan Missionary Society displayed a further 47 items from southern Africa, they also displayed 27 items from West Africa. The Church Missionary Society displayed 38 items from West Africa, where their work on the continent concentrated.</p>\n<p>Although there was slightly less material from the Pacific than from Africa (391 items), representing just over 25% of the total, well over half of this came from the London Missionary Society (214 items from across Polynesia), with smaller collections from the Wesleyans (98 items from New Zealand and Fiji) and the Paris Evangelical Society (61 items from Tahiti).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> A smaller group of items (18) from New Zealand were also displayed by the Church Missionary Society.</p>\n<p>Far less numerically represented were the Americas (95 items), representing just over 6% of the total. The largest group of material was from the Church Missionary Society, relating to the work of the North West American Mission (established in 1822) in Canada, mostly at Hudson’s Bay. Other material from Canada was displayed by the Wesleyan Missionary Society (13 items), alongside material from the West Indies (5 items). Caribbean material was also displayed by the London Missionary Society (5 items) and the Moravians (5 items), who also displayed material from Greenland (8 items).</p>\n<p>While the material on display betrays a strong connection to British territorial possessions in India, southern Africa, and Australia, much of the material was actually collected in adjacent areas, beyond formal colonial control. The majority of material came from the islands of the Pacific, the interior of Africa as well as Hudson’s Bay where engagements were largely of a commercial, rather than formally colonial kind, and indigenous leaders continued to exert considerable autonomy. This mid-nineteenth century pattern, of missionary activity operating alongside trade was also essentially true in China, where missionaries arrived alongside traders, expanding into the mainland in the wake of the opium wars (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/16-idol-taken-in-the-late-war/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 16</a>).</p>\n<p>Even in British India the colonial state was effectively run by a commercial trading corporation, the East India Company, at least until 1858 when the British State assumed direct control after the Indian Rebellion the previous year (the Dutch East India Company lost its control of Indonesia earlier, in 1800). Mid-nineteenth century Protestant missionary activity remained inseparable from free trade, at least in the British imagination, and it is perhaps unsurprising that many missionary societies were organised, like the LMS, along similar principles to joint-stock corporations, with headquarters in the City of London alongside trading companies. This pattern, however, began to change as a New Imperialism took shape across Europe in the final decades of the nineteenth century, fuelled in large part by competing nationalisms. Less than three years after the Paris exhibition, the French parliament declared war on Prussia, leading, in January 1871, to the fall of Paris.</p>\n<p>Produced in Paris in 1867, an album of twenty-six photographic albumen prints is now held at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles. It includes items from the <em>Mus_é_e des Missions Evangeliques</em> at Exposition Universelle.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This demonstrates a degree of experimentation with the photographic process, hawith prints on gilt, silver and variously coloured paper. The images are composites, with images of numbered items arranged to fill the frame.</p>\n<p>A printed table makes it possible to identify the items, including many from the London Missionary Society such as the shaman’s rattle from Guiana (in <a href=\"https://rosettaapp.getty.edu/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE376162\" target=\"_blank\">Plate 23</a> – <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/pehi/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 5</a>), religious images of Jagannath from India (in <a href=\"https://rosettaapp.getty.edu/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE376162\" target=\"_blank\">Plate 9</a> – <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/twenty-two-models-of-hindoo-deities/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 6</a>), as well as that of Paramasattee (in <a href=\"https://rosettaapp.getty.edu/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE376162\" target=\"_blank\">Plate 14</a> – <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/14-paramasattee/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 14</a>).</p>\n<p>Of particular interest, however, is Plate 16, composed of six labelled images, several photographs in their own right. These were clearly intended to show people from Southern Africa before and after conversion, the change marked by the adoption of European clothing.</p>\n<p>While a number of clubs were included in the photographic album, that associated with the death of John Williams evidently was not. Recognisable images of John Williams’ club do feature in the archive of the London Missionary Society at SOAS, long after the majority of the collection transferred to The British Museum between 1890 and 1910 (Chapters 22 &amp; 26).</p>\n<p>In November 1956, <em>News From Afar</em>, an updated version of the <em>Juvenile Missionary Magazine,</em> included a photograph of the club alongside the pocket watch of James Harris, who was killed alongside John Williams, in an article with the headline <em>Love, Murder, Salvation</em>. The accompanying text recounts the arrival of Williams from the perspective of those on the shore, including Kauiaui, who seems to have presented his club to visiting missionaries in late 1853, after Samoan teachers had brought the new religion to Erromanga.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In another series of images, also apparently from the mid-twentieth century, a modestly dressed young woman, most likely of Pacific ancestry, stands in front of a painting of John Williams holding the same club. It is not recorded in the archives  who she was, but the staging of this encounter, involving this ancestral missionary and his relics, was significant enough to be photographed.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The club appears on a list of items still in the collection of the Council for World Mission (the successor of the LMS) in 1975, and seems to have been borrowed for an exhibition at Reading Museum in late 1982, although it disappears from the archival records shortly after that.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Unlike many items, ‘No. 725’ from Erromanga awas able to resist the process by which the majority of items in the Missionary Museum were gradually converted into ethnographic specimens during the decades that followed.</p>\n<p>Whether it was the 1867 Paris exhibition that first attracted the attention of Augustus Wollaston Franks at the British Museum is unclear. It would not long, however, before the British Museum began to compete with the Missionary Museum as the most appropriate place in London for the storage and display of such items.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>I am very grateful to Jim Hamill at the British Museum Centre for Anthropology Library for alerting me to the Franks notebooks as well as for providing me with a scan of the relevant page.

Yonder is Ujiji, towards which we have so long marched and waded, and here in due order are our goods intact and ourselves in excellent health — 225 men in single file, each, save the head man, with his load on head or shoulder.</p>\n<p>In front walks the portly and consequential Songoro, bearing the Union Jack with white border, then the porters’ <em>kilangosi</em> [leading and senior guide and porter], with lofty head-dress of nodding ostrich plumes, perseveringly working his legs to give due sound to the iron bells hung round his knees; and then come box, and bag, and bundle, tents, pots, and kettles, and little bundles of porters’ personal effects. In the centre of the procession Juma Mackay displays on a long bamboo the dove of peace with olive branch.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This excerpt, from the journal of Edward Coode Hore, captures something of the relief with which he completed his journey of 800 miles, begun at Zanzibar more than a year earlier. Initially led by the Rev. Roger Price, an experienced missionary from southern Africa (who was married to Robert Moffat’s daughter – <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/17-model-bechuana-house/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 17</a>), the expedition began as a wagon train, with oxen and drivers brought from the Cape.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Progress was slow, only six or seven miles a day, and by October 1877 most of the oxen had died. As the men began to sicken with malaria, Price left for London to persuade the Society’s Directors they should employ <em>pagazi,</em>  or carriers. Of the six Europeans who set out for Ujiji in 1877 only four completed the journey and two of those died soon afterwards. This left only the two lay members of the group, Hore, a master mariner, and Walter Hutley, a missionary artisan.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Dr. Mullens, the London Missionary Society’s Foreign Secretary, arrived to oversee operations, joining a second expedition that left Zanzibar in June 1879. In less than a month, however, he too had died and was buried near a recently established Church Missionary Society station, Mpwapwa. Richard Lovett, official historian of the London Missionary Society, described the attempt to establish a new mission field in Central Africa as:</p>\n<p>The outcome of a lofty hope, floated upon the tide of a great enthusiasm, it has nevertheless been one long tragedy in the sacrifice of life on the parts of those who have attempted to work it, and in the disappointment of the fondest anticipations of those who projected it.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Following their arrival at Ujiji, Hore and Hutley lost no time establishing relationships with local Swahili speaking traders such as Tippu Tip, who dominated the settlement trading enslaved people, alongside other commodities such as ivory. Hore hired a vessel, the <em>Calabash,</em> fitting it with sails and rigging in the ‘English fashion’ in order to explore and map the lake, over 650km long and around 50km wide.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Reinforcements arrived in September 1879 in the form of two young missionary recruits. One of these, William Griffith, would establish a mission station at Mtowa [Mutoa] north of the Lukuga River on the western shore of Lake Tanganyika, in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Kasanga Mohongoro, the most important regional chief was welcoming, providing land, food and labourers to assist in establishing the station. The missionaries called this Plymouth Rock, after the place the Mayflower pilgrims disembarked in 1620, on their arrival in North America.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1880, following the arrival of a third LMS expedition, Hore returned to England to oversee the construction of a missionary steamer, arriving home on 23 February 1881.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The <em>Good News</em> was designed for lake conditions and transported from the East African coast in pieces, to be assembled on the shores of Lake Tanganyika and eventually launched in March 1885.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The archives of the British Museum include a list of 28 ‘Curios from Central Africa taken by the Rev. Ralph Wardlaw Thompson to Liverpool, April 12: 1881’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> At that time, Wardlaw Thompson, the son of an LMS missionary in India, had recently been appointed Foreign Secretary to replace Mullens. The list includes a generic selection of pots, pipes, and baskets, an ‘Arab slave collar’, a string of bells worn as anklets by <em>pagazi</em>, as well as a ‘wrist fetter’ from Ujiji with a sketch by Capt. E.C. Hore. This suggests it was likely Hore who brought these items to Britain. Towards the bottom of the page are listed:</p>\n<p>3 Wooden Images. Spirits of Ancestors. Ujiji.</p>\n<p>Another list in the same archival envelope describes what appear to be the same items under a different heading, Uguha:</p>\n<p>(3) Fetishes small (with one large)</p>\n<p>A third list in the same envelope includes:</p>\n<p>Fetishes (spirits of ancestors) (four 5) used by Natives (Uguha).</p>\n<p>When the London Missionary Society museum ultimately closed in 1910, three similar items were purchased by the British Museum (Af1910,-.339-341), where they were catalogued as:</p>\n<p>Fetish. Spirit of ancestors. Central Africa<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>What can these unusual artefacts, and the way they were described, tell us about changing attitudes to Africa in Victorian Britain? What do they reveal about British missionary engagements on the eve of the continent’s colonisation by European powers? How might they allow us to better understand the complex and evolving relationship between missionaries and anthropologists?</p>\n<p>When David Livingstone returned to Britain in December 1856, after sixteen years away, he was in many ways a fairly typical LMS missionary. Like his father-in-law, Robert Moffat (Chapter 17), John Williams (Chapter 15) and John Campbell (Chapter 3) before him, Livingstone wrote an account of his travels, <em>Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa</em>, published in November 1857.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> His now famous slogan ‘Christianity, Commerce and Civilisation’ was fairly conventional missionary rhetoric, as was his commitment to the abolition of slavery.</p>\n<p>Certainly, Livingstone had travelled across the Kalahari to Lake Ngami in 1849, and had crossed the continent from the Atlantic to the Indian ocean between 1853 and 1856, stopping at Mosi-oa-Tunya (the smoke that thunders) to give the waterfall a new name in honour of his Queen. But these achievements were recognised, at least initially, mainly by London’s Royal Geographical Society, established in 1830. It was the time Livingstone spent in Britain, as well as his subsequent career as an explorer, which appear to have made his name a household one that would endure for much of the twentieth century.</p>\n<p>In 1857, Livingstone resigned from the London Missionary Society to become a roving consul for the British government in Central Africa. He led an expedition up the Zambezi river using an iron river steamer transported from Britain, the <em>Ma Robert</em>. In many ways, Livingstone’s departure from the LMS marks a significant moment when missionary rhetoric, forged in evangelical churches during the first half of the century, was adopted by the British establishment. This paralleled the movement of a generation of young men, educated in public schools influenced by the muscular Christianity of Thomas Arnold, headmaster of Rugby School between 1828 and 1841, into positions of leadership across British Society.</p>\n<p>In December 1857, Livingstone was invited to address the University of Cambridge, having already spoken at the University of Oxford. One consequence of these lectures was the establishment of the Universities’ Mission to Central Africa, which brought together members of the Anglican universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and Trinity College Dublin, in response to Livingstone’s call for an expansion of missionary work in Africa, north of the Zambezi river.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Their first expedition, led by Bishop Charles Mackenzie in 1861, established a base near Lake Nyasa [Lake Malawi]. As with other attempts to settle European missionaries in the malarial zones of Central Africa, this did not last long, and in 1864 the mission withdrew to Zanzibar on the East African Coast.</p>\n<p>Similarly inspired, the LMS attempted to establish a mission to Sebitwane’s Kololo kingdom in the Upper Zambezi (as well as a mission to Mzilikazi’s Matabele, in what is now western Zimbabwe). After Livingstone’s withdrawal, other missionaries were found to undertake this, and on 8 July 1859 a group comprising of the Rev. Holloway Helmore, his wife Anne together with their four children, as well as Roger Price and his pregnant wife Isabella, supported by a number of Batswana from Kuruman, travelled north by wagon to Linyanti, near to what is now Namibia’s Caprivi strip. Arriving in mid-February 1860, they expected to soon be met by the roving David Livingstone.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 2 March, however, Malatsi, the driver of Price’s wagon died. Soon afterwards, the children began to die, followed by more Batswana – Setloke, Thaba from Lekatlong as well as his son. Anne and Holloway Helmore also died, followed by Isabella Price, leaving only Roger Price and two orphaned Helmore children. After many trials, they eventually returned to Kuruman on 14 February 1861.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Given this traumatic experience, it is perhaps unsurprising that Roger Price left the expedition to Lake Tanganyika when signs of illness began manifesting themselves nearly two decades later. Given this discouraging start, why did British Missionaries attempt, once again, to establish a mission in Central Africa during the 1870s?</p>\n<p>At least part of the answer has to do with the death of David Livingstone in 1872, and his elevation to the status of a national hero. The immediate result of Livingstone’s Zambezi expedition was discouraging, with the expedition recalled by the British government. In 1866, however, Livingstone returned to Africa, hoping to locate the source of the Nile. Apparently “lost”, Livingstone was located at Ujiji by the Welsh-American journalist Henry Morton Stanley on 10 November 1871 – a major scoop for the New York Herald.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Having been “found”, Livingstone remained in Africa, dying in May 1873. His African companions, led by Chuma and Susi, buried his internal organs and carried his bodily remains for 63 days to Bagamoyo on the Indian Ocean coast. Livingstone’s body was returned to London by steamer, kept in state at the Royal Geographical Society where it was identified using skeletal evidence of a lion attack decades earlier, and ultimately buried at Westminster Abbey on 18 April 1874, among the British nation’s heroes and poets.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was at least partly the impact of Livingstone’s state funeral, and the press attention it garnered, that inspired a series of further attempts to expand British Missionary activity in Central Africa during the subsequent decade. In 1874, the Universities Mission to Central Africa re-established a presence at Lake Nyasa, and in 1875, members of the Free Church of Scotland initiated the Livingstonia Mission to commemorate their celebrated countryman.</p>\n<p>A significant part of the impetus for the expansion of the London Missionary Society into Central Africa seems to have resulted from the missionary enthusiasms of Robert Arthington, a former Quaker from Leeds in Yorkshire. Inheriting a brewing fortune, Arthington invested this in British and American railways and used the resulting profits to support the spread of the Good News, at least partly motivated by a belief this might initiate Christ’s return.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In early 1876, Arthington offered £5000 to the London Missionary Society ‘towards the purchase of a steamer, and the establishment of a missionary station at some eligible place’ on the shores of Lake Tanganyika.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The Society’s income had not increased significantly since the late 1830s, apart from occasional peaks during fundraising for a missionary ship, making the promise of these additional funds extremely tempting – Arthington would offer another £3000 for the steamer itself in February 1880.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> What was presumably not anticipated, however, were the considerable costs associated with this enterprise, resulting in a combined deficit of nearly £40,000 for the LMS over the next three years.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although Arthington had been associated with a Baptist Church since 1848, he seems to have been happy to support the work of a range of missionary societies as long as they contributed to the global expansion of Christianity, his ultimate goal. Alongside donations to the London Missionary Society, he funded the Baptist Missionary Society to establish a mission on the Congo River in 1877, subsequently paying for a river steamer, the <em>Peace</em>, which he hoped would connect with the LMS mission at Lake Tanganyika. At the same time, he seems to have anonymously supported the Church Missionary Society in establishing a new mission field at Uganda, hoping that a chain of British Protestant mission stations might shed ‘a line of Gospel light across the “dark continent”’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Lake Tanganyika, equipped with a missionary steamer, was presumably intended to become a source of light at the heart of this imagined darkness.</p>\n<p>What then can we say with any certainty about the three carved artefacts at the British Museum, beyond the seemingly uncontested fact that they came from Central Africa? Were they from Ujiji, on the eastern coast of Lake Tanganyika as suggested by one list, or from Uguha on the opposite shore as suggested by the others? Were they ‘wooden images’ or ‘fetishes’, whatever that rather peculiar word might mean, or rather ‘spirits of ancestors’?  And if they had such spiritual significance, how were they acquired? By gift, purchase or theft?</p>\n<p>Searching for clues in the London Missionary Society archives, I came across a letter written by William Griffith at ‘Plymouth Rock’ on 19 May 1880.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This contains an underlined title,  Religious notions of the Waguha, under which he provided an account that would find its way into print in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> in December 1880:</p>\n<p>The religious notions of the Waguha are peculiar. There is a marked difference in this between the tribes on the eastern and tribes on the western shore of the Lake. While those on the eastern shore have neither images nor idols, those on the western have them in great numbers, and have certain beliefs connected with them. The first thing that strikes the African traveller on entering the western half of the continent is an image at the entrance to every village, and again at almost every native hut, especially that of the chief. Others are kept within huts, and their number varies according to the superstition of the worshipper. These images are carved after the shape of the human figure. Other images of lions are said to be kept in the corn-fields. The Waguha carve the images themselves, but the art exists in greater perfection among the Warua to the West.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Given these comments, we can reasonably conclude that the figures at the British Museum originated in Uguha, and if they weren’t obtained there by Griffith, Hutley or Hore, must have crossed the lake by other means. Mtowa near to ‘Plymouth Rock’ was a significant transit location for cargoes that crossed the lake as part of the caravan trade. Although the village only had a permanent population of around 300 people, Walter Hutley, observed many thousands of people passing through during the year he spent there.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In his letter, Griffith stated that some visitors came on trading expeditions from distant districts, lingering ‘for many days about our Mission House’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> One group of visitors, the Warua, brought cloth to trade, made from palm leaves. Hutley, however, suggested that there was little to distinguish the people of Uguha from the Warua ‘except in their language, which slightly differs from Kirua’. According to local tradition, their first chief had originally come from Goma, but had been joined ‘by many from Urua and Marungu’ to form ‘themselves into a a separate tribe’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The connection between the people living at Mutoa and the ‘Warua’ was clearly important enough to be expressed through myths of shared origin, as well as ongoing relationships of trade. Walter Hutley’s private diary suggested that one reason the Warua came to Mutoa was to embark on a joint raiding expedition to capture people to enslave.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Warua seems to have been a Kiswahili transliteration of the term Baluba, which itself referred to people living across a wide area of what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, united by a recognition of Luba forms of royal, ceremonial and sacred power associated with the <em>bambudye</em> secret societies.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The term Luba, alongside that of ‘Gua’ (as in Uguha), may have originally been names given to these people ‘by neighbours they have intimidated (‘Luba’ may originally have meant ‘the ferocious ones’).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Many ethnic names and identifications would be transformed over the decades that followed, as European colonialists attempted to identify and consolidate tribal units they could govern through forms of indirect rule.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Today, the people who live around Mutoa are known as the Holoholo, a name given to them by the Belgians on account their greeting. Given their earlier engagements with British missionaries, one wonders whether they were in fact just trying to say ‘Hello hello’?</p>\n<p>According to Hore, the people of Uguha adorned their bodies extensively, wearing elaborate head-dresses, as well as many ornaments of shell, bead, brass and copper wire. Their houses were ‘very beautiful structures’ arranged in regular rows or streets, and they produced:</p>\n<p>Very beautiful mats, basket-work, pottery, wooden bowls, and various small carved work<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>…</p>\n<p>Griffith went on to note that carved figures were known as ‘Mkissi’, explaining that this word ‘means the same thing as the ‘Kiswahili Mzimu’, or ‘the English Spirit’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Describing the rewards given to ‘Mkissi’ when they performed a service for the living, Griffith noted that they had shelters built for them and were presented with offerings of food and drink, becoming the focus for a range of ceremonies:</p>\n<p>the drum is played there, dances performed, and the good qualities of the Mkissi praised in songs.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Griffith also noted that spirits could also induce fear. He described the extreme reluctance with which anyone would approach the island opposite the mission station. Finally managing to land, Griffith was shown the location of a sacred grove inhabited by a powerful spirit associated with the grave of an important ancestor, Kirindi, but forbidden from approaching it. When the missionaries made a flagpole from a tree they cut down on the island, they were accused of magic and made to return it.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Griffith seems to have recognised that the primary ceremonial and religious focus for the people among whom he lived were the spirits of their ancestors, who visited them frequently, advising and warning them through dreams and visions. In many ways this was not unlike the situation in southern Africa, where LMS missionaries had worked for eight decades. What was distinctive, or to use Griffith’s word ‘peculiar’, were the carved figures which provided these spirits with a tangible body and a visible presence.</p>\n<p>Attempting to understand their function, Griffith drew on European frameworks, noting that although ‘these images… are prayed unto in difficulty and trouble, or when on a journey or in war’, people nevertheless acknowledged ‘a Higher Being…to whom the Mkissi is, as it were, only a means of approach’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This made Mkissi the equivalent of Roman Catholic saints, also frequently represented in material form.</p>\n<p>Griffith thought the idea of the Higher Being could have ‘been obtained from the Arabs’ (by which he meant Swahili traders and their Omani rulers) but equally suggested it might have originated locally, since ‘they have a word in their own language to denote this Higher Being’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>Any evidence of recognition for a high god was important for missionaries, providing the means by which projects of translation might proceed.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, a brief summary of Griffith’s description in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> was given in the scientific publication <em>Nature</em> on 23 December 1880.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The emerging scientific field of Anthropology, with its roots in Britain’s anti-slavery and evangelical movement, was greatly concerned with religious practices and beliefs, drawing heavily on the accounts of missionaries like Griffith.</p>\n<p>The Quaker anthropologist E.B. Tylor argued in <em>Primitive Culture,</em> his foundational 1871 book, that a belief in spiritual beings was an essential element in all religious practices. Critiquing the apparently contradictory statements of missionaries such as Robert Moffat (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/17-model-bechuana-house/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 17</a>) who declared that the people among whom he worked had no conception if immortality, while in the previous sentence giving a word for the shades or spirits of the dead, Tylor observed:</p>\n<p>But for the most part the “religious world” is so occupied in hating and despising the beliefs of the heathen whose vast regions of the globe are painted black on missionary maps, that they have little time or capacity left to understand them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Instead, Tylor argued for the development of ‘kindly interest’ in ‘all record of men’s earnest seeking after truth with such light as they could find’, and it seems that this message may have impacted William Griffith’s attempt to understand ‘The Religious Notions of the Waguha’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Tylor’s vision of the relationship between Christianity and other religions is worth considering, since it captures a perspective on civilisation and its history that was animating the establishment of museums of ethnology and anthropology across contemporary Britain, which would, in time, provide a home for many missionary collected artefacts (Chapter 22):</p>\n<p>No religion of mankind lies in utter isolation from the rest, and the thoughts and principles of modern Christianity are attached to intellectual clues which run back through far pre-Christian ages to the very origin of human civilisation, perhaps even of human existence.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Central to these ‘thoughts and principles’, proposed Tylor, was ‘the deep-lying doctrine of Spiritual Beings’ which he suggested formed the ‘groundwork of the Philosophy of Religion’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Tylor adopted the term Animism to describe this ‘ancient and world-wide philosophy, of which belief is the theory and worship is the practice’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Moving away from an older, and essentially Old Testament, notions of idols and idolatry, Tylor argued that it was the belief in spiritual beings, and attempts to engage with them that lay behind the creation of such artefacts.</p>\n<p>The first volume of Tylor’s <em>Primitive Culture</em> ended by declaring:</p>\n<p>The theory of the soul is one principal part of a system of religious philosophy, which unites, in an unbroken line of mental connexion, the savage fetish-worshipper and the civilised Christian. The divisions which have separated the great religions of the world into intolerant and hostile sects are for the most part superficial in comparison with the deepest of all religious schisms, that which divides Animism from Materialism.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>As someone who attended spiritualist seances (largely for scientific reasons), it is unclear on which side of this schism Tylor placed himself, but it is certainly true that missionaries and their potential converts were often united by a belief in spiritual beings, even if they disagreed about the best ways to engage with these.</p>\n<p>Since Griffith wrote his observations in May 1880, many missionaries, anthropologists and art historians have attempted to understand the ways in which Central Africa people understand and engage with the world of the spirits. What has emerged is a picture not significantly different to that articulated by Griffith. Indeed, W.F.P. Burton, Director of the Congo Evangelistic Mission, established in 1919, suggested that:</p>\n<p>Fear of the spirit-world holds the Luba in the most hideous thraldom, and is perhaps the biggest factor in controlling their entire lives from birth to death. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In a chapter of his book on <em>Luba Religion and Magic</em> with the title ‘The Idol’, Burton noted a confusion ‘among superficial observers of Luba custom’ between the spirit and the ‘idol-form in which he is supposed to live’:</p>\n<p>The distinction is as follows: a simple carved or moulded form is called &lt;&lt;nkishi&gt;&gt; (pl/ &lt;&lt;bankishi&gt;&gt;). It is a powerless lifeless image in wood or clay. The invisible being associated with a dead body is called a &lt;&lt;mukishi&gt;&gt; (pl. &lt;&lt;bakishi&gt;&gt;). One who is dead is often said to have become a &lt;&lt;mukishi&gt;&gt;, while a man who decorates the end of his walking stick with a human head is said to have carved a &lt;&lt;nkishi&gt;&gt;.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Linked by a common root ‘-kishi’ the spirit and the carved image are theoretically distinct, although not always in practice. Burton noted that a spirit had to be induced ‘to enter into the form prepared for it’ through a process known as ‘kuyola’:</p>\n<p>Often a piece of bone from a dead person is compounded with other ingredients {known as &lt;&lt;bijimba&gt;&gt;), in a horn or shell, and this charm is then inserted in the carved image, or tied about it, that the spirit may be induced to enter and to inhabit this form. When inhabited by a spirit, the form is no longer called a &lt;&lt;nkishi&gt;&gt; but a &lt;&lt;mukishi&gt;&gt;.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mary Nooter Roberts, who spent time researching Luba art during the 1980s, noted that the reason so many carvings take the form of female bodies is that only female bodies, perfected and enhanced by bodily decoration including deliberate scarification, were regarded as strong enough to contain powerful spirits, such as those of departed kings. Many Luba figures, like one of those at The British Museum (Af1910,-.441), gesture to their breasts, but rather than having sexual connotations this action alludes to a devotion to the secrets of Luba royal knowledge, safely kept there.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>How then should we regard the three figures now at The British Museum? Are they ‘bankishi’ or ‘bakishi’, carvings or spirits? One might assume that if they were simply carvings or ’bankishi’, that they would not display signs of either ‘kuyola’, or of subsequent veneration. The same figure (Af1910,-.441) shines with the repeated coatings of oil that have been applied to its surface, while the strips of metal at the top of the head likely represent the blacksmith’s anvil, a core symbol of the power across the Luba Kingdom. Its hair tresses likely form part of the magical additions made to the carving as part of the kuyola process.</p>\n<p>A second figure (Af1910,-,440) appears to have a removable lid on top of its head, covering a cavity into which magical substances were likely inserted. The third (Af1910,-,439) is an extraordinary assemblage of six faces, each looking in different directions, that includes no less than eight wooden horns, all of which appear to contain magical substances, <em>bijimba</em>. All three, it seems, are likely to have been ‘bakishi’, and therefore inhabited by spirits, at least at some point in their biographies.</p>\n<p>Burton tells us that when someone dies, ‘the charm is pulled out and the idol thrown away or allowed to rot’, but this does not seem to have happened in the case of these three images.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> If someone became sick, had repeated bad luck hunting, or his gardens failed, according to Burton, the owner of a mukishi might thrash it, starve it, or leave it out in the rain.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Might an uncooperative mukishi even have been given to a visiting European missionary?</p>\n<p>The diaries of Walter Hutley at Mutoa make it clear that he was actively engaged in building a personal collection. On 17 April 1880, he was given a bow stand and ‘some fine bananas’ by Kabulwe. On 1 July he bought another bow stand and a ‘small wooden medal’, the function of which he could not establish.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Five days later, Hutley received a load of cloth with which to buy curios for his friend Captain Carter, employed by the <em>Association Internationale Africaine</em> to deploy four Asian elephants as beasts of burden.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This significantly increased the resources available to Hutley, somewhat to the irritation of Griffith, purchasing further bow stands, as well as a number of axes.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Hutley was extremely interested in the use of bakishi, noting on 17 August 1880 that when Kabulwe’s wife went to fetch his drinking water, she carried a carved female figure with her and during that time was allowed to speak to no one.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> On 7 September 1880, he discovered all the villagers had brought their charms and bakishi out into the sun, it being the first day of the moon.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Hutley found a stone implement while bathing in the lake on 2 August 1880, he was told it was a relic of the past and that finding a spirit suggested he was fortunate. He was even given leaves to lay it on by Karembwe, who:</p>\n<p>said that now I was his brother this spirit was my father or some ancestor, and were I to leave it here and go to England it would find its way there. He gave me a lot of instructions as to what to do and promised that he himself would come up in the afternoon to give it the final touch required.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Whether Hutley followed these instructions is unclear, but when Edward Coode Hore addressed the Royal Geographical Society in November 1881 he referred to two pieces of stone, given to him by Hutley, stating that they were regarded with ‘great reverence as representatives or messengers from their deceased ancestors, storing them carefully away in little huts or baskets, carefully secured from damage’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Hore felt these might originally have been part of digging stick weights, as used in Southern Africa,. He then noted:</p>\n<p>I have brought home specimens of arms, pottery, basket-work, cotton, bark, and palm-fibre cloths, as well as samples of the lake water, the water of the hot springs of Uguha, palm oil, mpufu oil, cotton, tobacco, china, clay, and the salt of Uvinsa and Ugogo, which may be seen at the London Missionary Society’s museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Hore did not mention ‘wooden images’ or ‘spirits of the ancestors’.</p>\n<p>With no spectacular record of rapid conversion, it is hard to see why these items would have been given or sold to missionaries by the time Hore returned to Britain in late 1880. If they had been purchased from visiting Warua [Luba] as newly made carvings, it seems unlikely they would have shown signs of consecration through the addition of magical substances, or else might be expected to show more obvious signs of deconsecration, through their removal.</p>\n<p>Were they taken from their shrines by the missionaries, during Luba raids on other villages, or by representatives of the <em>Association International Africaine,</em> such as Captain Carter, which had established a station at Karema on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika? In addition, several scientific and geographical expeditions passed through the area at around this time including a French Geographical and Scientific Expedition led by the Abbé Debaize, as well as the Royal Geographical Society’s East African Expedition (which received assistance from LMS missionaries in early 1880).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Most of these visitors consisted of small groups of Europeans accompanied by large number of African porters, who trespassed into areas at the sufferance of local leaders. Indeed, the Royal Geographical Society expedition was extremely intimidated by the Warua [Luba] returning after many of their trade goods were forcibly taken from them.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> To desecrate a shrine under such conditions, several years before formal colonial conquest, would likely have placed Europeans at considerable risk. Indeed, Captain Carter was killed soon after he sent Hutley cloth to make a collection for him.</p>\n<p>Hutley continued to collect artefacts whenever he could, sending a small parcel of curiosities home to his friends in September 1880. He made no mention of acquiring any <em>bankishi</em> until he was preparing to leave, due to poor health, in May 1881. Visiting Kasanga Mahongoro at Ruanda, he was shown into:</p>\n<p>a house apart where Shumari (his translator) made known to Kasanga that I had come to salute him, and as, I was going home, I wanted a spear and an Mkisi. They were soon after brought and two loads of meat given me, as well, for food. After an hour of more rest I returned to Butonga rather done up.</p>\n<p>Was this Mkisi deconsecrated before being given to Hutley? Did it come from the Kasanga’s personal collection? On 3 June, Hutley returned with presents requested of him. Once again they went into a house ‘to <em>sema magambo</em> [discuss negotiate]’ and he opened a box that contained three cloths, a piece of soap and a razor. His exchange partner was evidently pleased, but would ultimately have preferred to receive a gun.</p>\n<p>Hutley noted that in this house were ‘a large number of images female and male’, including one female with its head in the middle of a bunch of arrows. Asking about its function, he found people ‘very chary of telling me about their customs with regard to these figures’, but learned that they ‘pray in some manner to these by making certain mixtures of herbs and roots and placing them in the interior of the figure and saying at the same time the things they want’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>One of the three figures now at The British Museum, that with six faces (Af1910,-,439), appeared under the title ‘Spirits of Ancestors’  in a section on <em>Odds &amp; Ends from our Museum</em> in <em>News from Afar,</em> an LMS children’s magazine in March 1897.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The article states that it was brought to England by Walter Hutley, who did not leave Central Africa until near the end of 1881, suggesting it would not have been among the items taken to Manchester in April that year.</p>\n<p>In his diary, Hutley records that on 16 June 1881, as he was preparing to leave:</p>\n<p>I receive a large, six-headed image from Griffith to take home to the Society, also a small parcel for some friend of his. Arrange with Palmer about sending over the boat as soon as possible. In the evening Kasanga Mahongoro sent word that he wanted us to take over some eight men and loads to Ujiji. We sent word back that our boat was too heavily laden this voyage.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1899, the same six-headed figure appeared in a photograph that accompanied a magazine article on the London Missionary Society museum, together with three other items captioned as ‘Wooden Representations of the Spirits of Ancestors from Central Africa’. While the figures on the left and right are recognisably the ones now at The British Museum, the location of the smaller figure at the front centre of the photograph, almost entirely covered by its palm fibre dress, is unknown today.</p>\n<p>At the point this image was made, all the female images seem to have had some form of dress below the waist. One might expect these were missionary coverings, added for modesty, but their materials suggest their dresses were made in Africa and likely accompanied the items to Europe. Arriving in Europe were they simply ‘wooden images’, or were they still inhabited by the ‘spirits of ancestors’?</p>\n<p>William Burton tells us that if a charm was removed from the location in which it has been erected:</p>\n<p>the spirit is supposed to depart at once, and the empty form which remains is regarded with contempt as useless.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Perhaps these figures had been ‘bakishi’, inhabited by the ‘spirits of ancestors’  through the <em>kuyola</em> process, but having been removed from the locations they were at work, lost their spiritual potency to become ‘bankishi’ or simple ‘wooden images’ once again.</p>\n<p>When European modernists began to look at African sculpture with new eyes in the early decades of the twentieth century, these same images would come to be imbued with a new kind of potency (see Chapter 27).</p>\n<p>An image of one of these artefacts (Af1910,-.441) was included in a 1920 article on ‘Negro Art’, still wearing its fibre dress. The text suggested that until that point such works in the British Museum has been regarded as ‘curious and picturesque’, but that this:</p>\n<p>prevented them from seeing in these wooden sculptures and rare bronzes the only thing which matters — the element of essential beauty. We cannot feel this beauty until we have discarded the vulgar sentiment, — in itself a civilised barbarism…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>When I began work on a display of material related to the Baptist Missionary George Grenfell at Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery over two decades ago, I did not imagine it would open a window on a period where European missionaries and explorers teemed across the the African continent on the eve of colonisation. It was Prof. Brian Stanley’s work on Robert Arthington which enabled me to begin to join the dots between seemingly distinct missionary projects.</p>\n<p>I am extremely grateful to Prof. Allen F. Roberts for his input at an early stage of planning this chapter. I have been lucky to have worked alongside Prof. John Mack and Prof. David Maxwell, from both of whom I have learnt a great deal about Central Africa. I also had the privilege to supervise Dr Amelia King’s PhD on photography associated with the Baptist Missionary Society in Congo.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div><section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Hore, Edward Coode. 1892. <em>Tanganyika: Eleven Years in Central Africa,</em> London: Edward Stanford, pp. 61-62; <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tGEMn9NP054C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=edward%20hore%20tanganyika&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tGEMn9NP054C&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=edward hore tanganyika&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Walls, Andrew. 1998.

publication of this renowned image occurred on March 11, 1936, on the third day that the San Francisco News ran a story about the pea pickers’ camp at Nipomo. It was also featured as a full-page reproduction in September 1936 issue of <em>Survey Graphic</em>, titled “Draggin’-Around People” and captioned “A blighted pea crop in California in 1935 left the pickers without work. This family sold their tent to get food.” Also in this issue was an article by Taylor entitled “From the Group Up.” His report on demonstration projects of the New Deal’s Resettlement Administration in Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and California was illustrated with four more picture by Lange.</p>\n<p>Since it was first published, this composition, best known as <em>Migrant Mother</em>, has come to represent not only the pictorial archive created by the RA/FSA during the 1930s but also the Great Depression itself. Posters and other publicity of later activists fighting racial, economic, and political oppression have borrowed from Lange’s icon of the time.

With Lange’s artistry, Owens took on the timeless quality of Eugéne Delacroix’s strong female rebel (<em>Liberty Leading the People</em>), Jean-François Millet’s peasant woman (the agrarian ideal), Honoré Daumier’s laundresses (the working woman) and Käthe Kollwitz’s proletarian woman warrior (one of the mothers leading her <em>Peasants’ War</em>).</p>\n<p>Owens, although she became famous, did not enjoy, even momentarily, the life of a celebrity. She had three more children and kept moving with her family, following the California crops. She did become involved in efforts to organize farm labor and would sometimes serve as the straw boss, one who negotiates wages for migrants as the picking season begins. She was still working in the fields at age fifty before finally marrying again (to George Thompson) and settling into a stable life in Modesto, California.</p>\n<p>Several Lange images from the same photoshoot with Owens and her children exist <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/migrant-mother/introduction\" target=\"_blank\">in other collections</a>. These give us the chance to consider the  many varied choices in composition that Lange made in producing her iconic final image.</p>\n<figure id=\"mother-variants\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-variants\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><canvas-panel canvas-id=\"http://localhost:8000/iiif/mother-variants/canvas\" choice-id=\"\" height=\"\" iiif-content=\"\" manifest-id=\"http://localhost:8000/iiif/mother-variants/manifest.json\" preset=\"responsive\" region=\"0,0,826,1024\" virtual-sizes=\"\" width=\"\"> </canvas-panel></a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-variants\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1.1</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Alternate versions of Dorothea Lange’s <em>Migrant Mother</em>, 1936.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"mother-annotations\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-annotations\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"/iiif/mother-annotations/base/static-inline-figure-image.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-annotations\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1.2</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">This version of the print from the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division is mounted on paper board and includes an original FSA label.

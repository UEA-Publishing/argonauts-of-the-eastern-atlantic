One way of understanding the title of Malinowksi’s book is to regard the islanders as early twentieth-century equivalents of the sailors who crewed the <em>Argo</em> of Ancient Greek myth, a ship captained by Jason and protected by the Gods. But <em>Argonauts</em> was not the only book published in 1922 to adopt a classicising title – James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> – a central text in the canon of literary modernism – transposed the voyages and adventures of Odysseus, chronicled in Homer’s Odyssey, onto an ordinary day in Dublin, with Leopold Bloom as its hero.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A worn copy of Ulysses by James Joyce, featuring a blue cover with white lettering, resting on a flat surface.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-3.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ulysses by James Joyce, first edition published in 1922</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A worn copy of Ulysses by James Joyce, featuring a blue cover with white lettering, resting on a flat surface.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-3.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Ulysses by James Joyce, first edition published in 1922</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Modernism as an aesthetic and literary movement was consolidated in the years after the First World War – a period in which the world was essentially remade. In 1922, after around 750 years as a centre of English power, Dublin became the capital of the independent Irish Free State.  Old ideas and established authorities were challenged as a new generation of men, Malinowksi and Joyce among them, asserted themselves. If the <em>Argonauts</em> were the Kiriwinans of the Kula ring, then it seems that like Leopold Bloom in <em>Ulysses</em>, Malinowski was the modern(ist) Jason – the legendary hero tasked with bringing back the golden fleece.</p>\n<p>It helps here to know that one of the major works of anthropology before the First World War was <em>The Golden Bough</em> by James Frazer, originally published in two volumes in 1890, three volumes in 1900 and an incredible twelve volumes in the third edition between 1906 and 1915. Frazer’s comparative compendium of mythology developed in relation to the <em>Rex Nemorensis</em>, the priest-king of the sacred grove on the shores of Lake Nemi in Italy.</p>\n<p>In order to become the priest-king, one had to kill the existing priest in combat, after taking the golden bough from one of the trees in the sacred grove. Frazer suggested that the institution of the death and reinstallation of the priest-king was an embodiment of the dying and reviving solar god, central to mythological ideas all over the world – including the death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>\n<p>Malinowski himself had been inspired to become an anthropologist by reading <em>the Golden Bough</em> in three volumes, borrowed from the University of Cracow library:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I realised then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact sister studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Frazer was the reigning priest-king of early twentieth-century British Anthropology, Malinowski’s publication of <em>Argonauts</em> can be read as him presenting his own golden bough. In asking James Frazer to write book’s preface, Malinowski was essentially asking for the inauguration of his own reign – like Jason claiming his rightful place as king following presentation of the golden fleece. Malinowski is remembered for developing the notion of the charter myth, and he certainly deployed the myth of his fieldwork in the Trobriands as a charter from which to establish Social Anthropology as a new approach.</p>\n<p>The Golden Bough_ was also a significant influence on Joyce (as well as T.S. Eliot, who published <em>The Waste Land</em> in 1922), as well as other modernists such as Joseph Conrad. Indeed, Malinowski admired Conrad, a fellow Pole, telling Brenda Seligman that ‘Rivers is the Rider Haggard of Anthropology, I shall be his Conrad!’ (Young 2004, 236). By aligning W.H.R. Rivers (who died in 1922) with Rider Haggard, Malinowski was suggesting he exemplified an imperial tradition of British writing about the non-European ‘other’ which he hoped to overturn in the way Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em> upended romantic Imperial narratives into a denunciation of colonialism, highlighting the ways it dehumanised the Europeans who participated in it.</p>\n<p>Although Malinowski presented his work as inaugurating something of a revolution in Anthropology, his approach was significantly shaped by his engagement with Frazer, providing at the very least an explanation for the title of his book. In the same way that Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em> is structured around the story of a European’s voyage to the interior of the African continent, where he comes to dominate and rule, Malinowski’s account, while ostensibly about the Kula, also emphasises his own heroic role as an ethnographer who gains an understanding of the operation of Kula that is essentially superior to that of those who participate in it. This is an anthropological version of ‘the hero’s journey’ myth – explored by Joseph Campbell’s 1949 book, <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</em> (a major influence on George Lucas’ Star Wars franchise and not unrelated to what Teju Cole, in 2012, called ‘the White-Saviour Industrial complex’).</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A dark, historical image captures a group of individuals seated inside a tent, with figures standing outside amidst tropical vegetation.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-4.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Bronislaw Malinowski in his tent in the Trobriands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A dark, historical image captures a group of individuals seated inside a tent, with figures standing outside amidst tropical vegetation.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-4.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Bronislaw Malinowski in his tent in the Trobriands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A coastal settlement with huts among palm trees, set against a lush jungle backdrop.

It was not uncommon for mid-century Europeans to see themselves as the ones who ‘really’ understood artistic or ceremonial practices in other parts of world. Although twentieth-century Social Anthropology has long been recognised as a modernist form of <em>Writing Culture</em> (Clifford and Marcus 1986), the fact is that <em>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</em> is still widely regarded as an exemplary ethnographic text.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Malinowski’s description of romantically isolated fieldwork remains the standard against which many doctoral anthropology students measure their own efforts, suggesting it has been hard for the discipline to escape the dominating and perhaps domineering influence of the modernists, whose charter myths continue to position them as founding ancestors, or priest-kings in the cult of Social Anthropology.</p>\n<p>For all Malinowksi’s iconoclastic ambitions, the narrative structure of his account betrays a continuity with older European accounts of encounter with other parts of the world. It is striking that central targets for the Modernist generation, from which they sought to distance themselves, perhaps as a result of the what Freud in 1917 called the ‘narcissism of small differences’, were missionaries, but also the museum collections – assembled by anthropological museums during the previous thirty years.</p>\n<p>Modernist anthropologists railed against what they represented as ‘conjectural history’ – the efforts of those who attempted to build frameworks for human history extending beyond the European old world on the basis of facts and artefacts assembled in Europe – an approach increasingly derided as ‘armchair anthropology’. Modernism, and anthropological modernism in particular, was unrelentingly presentist (Fardon 2005). The aim was to explain the operation of society by reference to its contemporary features and characteristics, in the way an anatomist might explain the function of different organs of the body without reference to their evolutionary history.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Cover of Trobriand Cricket.

His access to the field, like that of many anthropologists of his generation was made substantially possible by established networks of Christian missionaries who had operated in Africa and the Pacific for over a century. In the case of the Trobriands, the Methodist missionary M.K. Gilmour had already been stationed at Kiriwina for 14 years when Malinowski arrived in 1915 (Young 1984, 17). Many of Malinowski’s immediate predecessors, the first generation of professional anthropologists, found employment in museums filled by collections assembled in Europe largely through the efforts of previous generations of missionaries.</p>\n<p>In <em>the Right to Look- a counterhistory of visuality</em>, Nicholas Mirzoeff (2011) has suggested that the missionary can be regarded as the metonymic figure of what he called the ‘Imperial Complex of Visuality’, dominant between 1860 and 1945 – as heroes who brought ‘Light into Darkness’ as part of a global “pastorate”. This draws on Michel Foucault’s insight that many of the technologies of governmentality of the modern state were assimilated from forms of Christian pastoral power (Goulder 2007). Thus an enquiry into missionary practice and image making has the potential to illuminate what Talal Asad (2003) has called <em>Formations of the Secular.</em></p>\n<p>Historians such as Boyd Hilton (1988) have demonstrated the significant influence that the 18th century evangelical revival had on British intellectual and cultural forms during the nineteenth century. I would go as far as to suggest that the public museums that took shape in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, as part of what Tony Bennett (1988) has called the ‘exhibitionary complex’, can be regarded as an expansion of the ‘missionary exhibitionary complex’ which developed in evangelical circles earlier in the century. My intention in presenting chronologically ordered chapters is to provide a more detailed insight into the development of these related exhibitionary complexes.</p>\n<p>However, I remain conscious of the textual form I am creating – it would easy to describe a narrative arc from origin, through rise, to decline and fall. But would this simply be an appealing way to shape a story out of the messy details of historical events and sources? A Foucauldian genealogy might trace relationships of descent and alliance, but my intention here is less to construct a genealogy than to provide a gallery of ancestral portraits, which the reader/viewer is encouraged to explore in order to recognise and identify family resemblances.</p>\n<p>Marilyn Strathern (1990) has described the typical approach of modernist anthropology to both artefacts and events as one that makes sense of them in relation to a context. She has contrasted this with what she has called a Melanesian approach to images, whether events or artefacts, as embodying history themselves – they do not need to be “explained” by reference to events outside themselves, but are known by their effects. An image or artefact, when approached as a <em>prestation</em> (or gift) demands reciprocation, so that it comes to be understood through the construction of further artefacts in order to see what their further effects will be, with revelations coming as something of a surprise.</p>\n<p>I would collapse Strathern’s dichotomy between the Melanesian and European approaches (which is itself essentially Modernist) by suggesting that the texts constructed to make sense of things by “Europeans”, by which she essentially means modernist anthropologists (Strathern recognises that museum curators are more like “Melanesians” than her “Europeans”) are artefacts themselves, containing their own contexts. In a world in which the British Library is a distinct institution from the British Museum, we might think of texts as unlike other artefacts, but it is in fact not long since they were part of a single institution (1973). Indeed, most libraries contain artefacts that could happily form part of a museum collection, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>One can read Malinowski’s text as an artefact of a particular type, constructed to evoke a context for the Kula that will allow himself and other Europeans to make sense of it. But typically, the institutions of human life do not come with such manuals. One joins the game of life in the midst of play, and learns the rules by watching and joining in. In Roy Wagner’s (1981) terms, Malinowski, as the ethnographer, “invents” the culture of the Trobriands through the construction of his text(s). Strathern suggests that as part of the modernist approach to Anthropology “it is taken for granted that we study the significance which such artefacts have for the people who make them, and thus their interpretations of them”, but if these assumptions were at least identifiable by 1990, I suggest they should no longer be taken for granted.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Close-up of a decorative textile featuring circular coral and shell beads, strung together with dark thread on a blue fabric base.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-7.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Soulava kula valuable, collected by Bronislaw Malinowski in the Trobriand Islands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">British Museum 20122037.1</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Close-up of a decorative textile featuring circular coral and shell beads, strung together with dark thread on a blue fabric base.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-7.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Soulava kula valuable, collected by Bronislaw Malinowski in the Trobriand Islands</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">British Museum 20122037.1</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>A hundred years after the publication of Malinowksi’s <em>Argonauts</em>, I am seeking to revisit the moment of possibility represented by 1922, a return to what Michael North (1999) has called the ‘scene of the modern’. While the COVID19 pandemic has been very different to the First World War, it nevertheless provides a break from business as usual which makes it possible to consider alternative ways of approaching things.</p>\n<p>How best can one write about human life in a way that resists the urge to endlessly contextualise – a tendency to lapse into an essentially theological mode of writing that attempts to elucidate what Malinowski liked to call ‘the native’s point of view’?  Who are /were ‘the natives’ in encounters between missionaries and the people they worked with, and did they really have a single point of view? Is it possible to capture the contingency, uncertainty and provisional nature of much of human life by constructing our accounts differently?</p>\n<p>David Graeber and David Wengrow (2021; 5, 24) have recently challenged us to write history ‘as if it consisted of people one would have been able to talk to, when they were still alive’ as part of an attempt to construct a new science of history that ‘restores our ancestors to their full humanity’. It is to this challenge that I have attempted to respond.</p>\n<p>In his work on the encounters between missionaries and the Yoruba, in what is now Nigeria, J.D.Y. Peel (1995; 2000) drew attention to the centrality of narratives, both in terms of how they structure historical accounts, but also the way in which they were used by participants in these encounters to make sense of their own experiences.</p>\n<p>In response to the work of the Comaroffs (1991, 1997), whose work concentrated on the connections between missionary encounters and the expansion of global capitalism, Peel has suggested that accounts of missionary encounters that do not recognise the centrality of religious narratives runs the risk of reading like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.</p>\n<p>World religions like Christianity, Peel (1995, 9) suggests, are long <em>durée</em> ‘vehicles of trans-historical memory, ceaselessly re-activated in the consciousness of their adherents’. Those engaged in missionary encounters frequently compared and judged their own actions on the basis of biblical precedent, drawing on the complex strands of both the Old and New Testaments to make sense of their own encounters.</p>\n<p>In constructing his own account, Peel worried about ‘how to simplify a complicated and many-stranded story without distorting its essential elements’ (Peel 2000, 44), ultimately arriving at a material metaphor:</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-8\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-8\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Colorful braided rope featuring intertwining red, blue, and green strands, creating a vibrant decorative pattern.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-8.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Three stranded cord</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Colorful braided rope featuring intertwining red, blue, and green strands, creating a vibrant decorative pattern.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-8.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Three stranded cord</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A multi-coloured wooden cord, with component fibres of different lengths – Yoruba, colonial, Christian, and other – that give it structure by pulling both together and against one another.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is striking that in setting out his vision of the history of human thought, Frazer (1911, 307-8) constructed a similar material metaphor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A web of three different threads – the black thread of magic, the red thread of religion, and the white thread of science, if under science we may include those simple truths drawn from the observation of nature…</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Could we survey the web of thought from the beginning, we should probably perceive it to be at first a chequer of black and white… But carry your eye further along the fabric and you will remark that, while the black thread and white chequer still run through it, there rests on the middle portion of the web, where religion has entered most deeply into its texture, a dark crimson stain…</em></p>\n<p>In constructing an artefactual history of the London Missionary Society, my ambition is similarly to construct a narrative out of multiple interlocking strands, coming in and out of conjunction with one another in different ways at different times.</p>\n<p>Textual models range from nineteenth century novels such as George Elliot’s <em>Middlemarch</em> and Herman Melville’s <em>Moby Dick</em> to more recent works such as David Mitchell’s <em>Cloud Atlas,</em> or even Deleuze and Guattari’s <em>A Thousand Plateaus.</em> But in the deeper past we might consider the multi-stranded text of Herodotus’ <em>Histories</em>, or even the books of the Bible itself. In attempting to go beyond what Ann-Laura Stoler (2009) has called ‘familiar stories with predictable plots’, we have a range of textual artefacts to consider as models that do not conform to modernist monomyths – a significant example drawn from twentieth century anthropology would be Gregory Bateson’s (1936) <em>Naven</em>.</p>\n<p>I am not advocating a straightforwardly neo-Frazerian approach, but I do feel that it may be revealing to consider missionary encounters, as well as the way they have been narrated in light of the archetypical story of the priest-king at Nemi. Indeed, I am tempted to regard many of the artefacts collected and brought to Europe as essentially equivalent to Trobriand Kula valuables, but also to the Golden Fleece which Jason returned with to prove his right to rule.</p>\n<p>The widespread adoption of Christianity in large parts of the world over the past two centuries, including Africa and the Pacific in particular, is a transformation of world-historical significance that cannot be accounted for simply by the imposition of European power, or the cultural logic of capitalism – many missionaries were essentially powerless strangers, at least at the point they arrived.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-intro-part-1-9\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-intro-part-1-9\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Cover of Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, featuring vibrant colors, intricate patterns, traditional motifs, and a rural scene.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-9.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe - cover for first edition, published in 1958</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Cover of Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe, featuring vibrant colors, intricate patterns, traditional motifs, and a rural scene.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/introduction/intro-part-1-9.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe - cover for first edition, published in 1958</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>I take further inspiration from Chinua Achebe’s 1958 <em>Things Fall Apart</em> – an African response to Conrad’s <em>Heart of Darkness</em> which recognises the tensions inherent in existing structures of power, and the forms of possibility that the arrival of outsiders missionaries presented for many people. The stranger missionaries did not become priest-kings entirely by their own efforts.</p>\n<p>If the functionalist anthropology of the Modernists concerned itself with how society maintains itself as a functioning system in a steady state or dynamic equilibrium, giving rise to a conception of culture as essentially inherited and determinative, then in a world structured around forms of managerialism intent on maintaining an unsustainable status quo, it has become increasingly urgent to find ways of writing about the mechanisms of societal transformation. How does society renew itself? How does newness enter the world (Bhabha 1994)?</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2><strong>Notes</strong></h2>\n<p><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Peel, J.

Covering the floor of the observation deck at the UK’s National Maritime Museum, it reduces the globe to something that can be over-seen and over-stepped.</p>\n<p>The museum in which it takes centre stage looks up towards the hill on which the Royal Observatory is perched – home of the Greenwich meridian and zero point for a reckoning of time. Rooted in one location, at the middle of the map, the museum is a ship of time, with deck-like galleries of public display and dark hold-like stores carrying vast cargoes into the future.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c1-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c1-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A screen shot of a Tweet showing a performance featuring dancers in traditional attire, celebrating the opening of the new galleries at the Royal Museums Greenwich.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-3.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Screenshot of Tweet about Beats of Polynesia performance. 16 second video available here</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A screen shot of a Tweet showing a performance featuring dancers in traditional attire, celebrating the opening of the new galleries at the Royal Museums Greenwich.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-3.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Screenshot of Tweet about Beats of Polynesia performance. 16 second video available here</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>I was there for the gala opening of the museum’s <a href=\"https://www.rmg.co.uk/national-maritime-museum/attractions/sackler-gallery-pacific-encounters\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Encounters gallery</a>. On a raised platform at the north end of the map, a pair of dancers wearing fibre dance skirts with shells around their necks were performing, accompanied by drummers from <a href=\"https://www.mattersmusical.com/artists/beats-of-polynesia/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Beats of Polynesia</em>,</a> a London based collective whose <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beatspolynesia?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter profile</a> suggests they exist to ‘bring a taste of the Pacific islands to the United Kingdom &amp; Europe’.</p>\n<p>It was 19 September 2018, but their performance recalled other times and other places. In particular, it made me think of a painting, recently hung in a gallery on the other side of the Great Map – <em>The Cession of Matavai</em> – as it is often known. Painted by the English painter Robert Smirke, it commemorates the arrival of the first group of British missionaries at Tahiti in 1797, intent on taking a taste of the UK &amp; Europe, and in particular Protestant Christianity, to the heart of the Pacific.</p>\n<p>But the European perspective that the painting provides was only ever one side of the story – illustrating some of the ways in which Pacific islands and Islanders have been imagined and visualised in Europe over the past 250 years. The new gallery formed part of the Endeavour Galleries project, named for the HMS Endeavour, a British Navy research vessel that left the British Isles in 1768 under the command of Captain James Cook.</p>\n<p>The Endeavour’s main mission had been to observe the passage of Venus across the face of the sun at Tahiti, on the other side of the globe. The story of Cook’s voyages has been so frequently told that it has become part of the myth through which Britain has come to understand itself and its encounters with other parts of the world. The heroic tale of the son of a farm labourer, who through his own ability and hard work rose to command a ship, to literally put Australia on the map, and who in the end was murdered on a beach in Hawai’i, remains hard for us to escape.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c1-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c1-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A metal sculpture of a dismembered leg and boot, with a historic building and a Canadian flag in the background.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-4.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Remains of Captain Cook statue at Victoria, British Columbia.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Image Mike McArthur/CBC</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A metal sculpture of a dismembered leg and boot, with a historic building and a Canadian flag in the background.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-4.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Remains of Captain Cook statue at Victoria, British Columbia.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Image Mike McArthur/CBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>However, in recent years statues to Captain Cook across the Pacific have been a focus for protests about colonialism and its contemporary legacies. On Thursday 1 July 2021, a Cook statue in Victoria on Vancouver Island was torn down and thrown into the harbour by protesters highlighting the ongoing mistreatment of indigenous women and children in contemporary Canada.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>We clearly need to unpack the processes by which white European men were fashioned into the heroes around which so many of the tales of colonial history came to be told. In trying to develop accounts of the past that are recognisable to the descendants of the colonised, as well as the colonisers – as well as those of us whose ancestors came from both sides of what can, at times, feel like an unbreachable historical antagonism – we need to de-centre these historical celebrities within the tales that we tell.</p>\n<p>Disrupting what Ann-Laura Stoler has called familiar stories with predictable plots, our challenge is to find other ways of narrating the histories of encounter between Europe and other parts of the world. As an artefactual history, with its primary focus on the things through which relationships between Europeans and others were mediated, this work is an experimental attempt to respond to this challenge.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks before the gallery opening at Greenwich, I left my job as a curator at the <a href=\"https://maa.cam.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology</a> in Cambridge. The collection there includes a number of historic artefacts collected during Cook’s voyages that remain the celebrities of the collection. Regularly visited by researchers and loaned for exhibition around the world, their carbon footprint was significantly higher than mine in most of the years I worked at the museum, and in the anniversary year of 2018 in particular.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c1-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c1-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A serene coastal scene with fishermen in boats, lush mountains, and colorful sails under a pastel sunset.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-5.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">A View of Matavai Bay in the Island of Otaheite by William Hodges, 1776.

Hodges was a romantic who depicted Tahiti as a latter-day Eden in the paintings he completed after his return to London, paid for by the British Admiralty. Hodges made a number of paintings of Matavai Bay and experimented with how to present this landscape – a natural paradise, untouched by European influence, or alternatively a backdrop against which to contrast the sailing vessels, forms of dress and buildings of one island people with that of another.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c1-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c1-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A group of individuals from diverse backgrounds gathers in a lush, tropical landscape, showcasing a moment of cultural exchange and interaction.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-7.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">The Cession of Matavai by Robert Smirke, 1798.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">National Maritime Museum (ZBA6683)</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A group of individuals from diverse backgrounds gathers in a lush, tropical landscape, showcasing a moment of cultural exchange and interaction.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-7.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">The Cession of Matavai by Robert Smirke, 1798.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">National Maritime Museum (ZBA6683)</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>While the Cession of Matavai owes something to these paintings of the bay, it depicts events two decades after Hodges had left. I had last seen the painting halfway up the stairs of the library at the University of London’s <a href=\"https://www.soas.ac.uk/library/\" target=\"_blank\">School of Oriental and African Studies</a>, where a number a palm prints suggested it was not quite out of student reach. Five years earlier I was involved in brokering the transfer of the painting, along with a number of other artefacts, across London from the Council for World Mission in Westminster to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.</p>\n<p>Since then, the painting had been professionally conserved, and I had been told that the removal of two hundred years of London grime had revealed previously obscure details. What this painting, alongside other missionary artefacts displayed in the gallery allowed the Maritime Museum to do for the first time, was to tell a story of Pacific Encounters that included Britain’s history of overseas missionary engagements alongside the naval history that had been central to the museum’s purpose since its establishment in 1934.</p>\n<p>No less maritime in nature, missionary history has frequently been told through accounts of ‘heroes’ in the mode of Captain Cook. But it is also a history of encounter that extends far beyond fairly short-lived expeditions of exploration.</p>\n<p>Missionaries generally stayed in the places they were sent for longer periods, and the success of their work – convincing people to convert to Christianity – depended on developing detailed understandings of the lives of the people amongst whom they lived, even if their ultimate intention was to transform these. If the museum was going to tell a story of Britain’s Pacific Encounters, I was pleased it now extended beyond the initial impressions of Captain Cook and William Hodges. But the Cession of Matavai, remains an initial impression.</p>\n<p>With Hodges’ mountains in the background, it shows a group of people assembled around a clearing, where the light, undoubtedly signifying the presence of God, shines brightly. It is an image of missionary arrival that imagines a future which has become our history. The painting was commissioned from the London painter Robert Smirke by the Directors, effectively board members, of the recently established Missionary Society. Smirke had never been to Tahiti, although he had undoubtedly seen Hodges’ paintings. He was, however, experienced at creating images based on literary texts, from Shakespeare to Cervantes. In this case the text was the journal of James Wilson, captain of the ship that delivered the missionaries to Tahiti.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c1-8\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c1-8\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Three individuals pose together, one in a white dress, while two men in 18th-century attire stand beside her, smiling warmly.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-8.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Captain James Wilson and First Mate William Wilson (his nephew) detail from stipple engraving of Smirke’s painting by Francesco Bartolozzi, 1803.

A veteran of the Battle of Bunker Hill in the American War of Independence, he joined the East India Company as a naval officer, just as Warren Hastings was expanding the power base of the Company to some consternation back in London.</p>\n<p>Captured by the French, Wilson escaped by swimming to shore where he was recaptured by the forces of Hyder Ali, Sultan of Mysore, and imprisoned for nearly two years. On release he enriched himself working for the Company in India, finding religion only after his retirement back in Britain, still in his thirties.</p>\n<p>Wilson read in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em> about the intention to send missionaries to the Pacific and volunteered his services. For evangelicals, motivated by an increasingly central understanding of divine Grace, it was precisely Wilson’s earlier life of sin followed by conversion that demonstrated he was God’s choice for the job.</p>\n<p>The missionary movement gained significant momentum in the early 1790s, prompted, so the story goes, by the Christian cobbler, William Carey’s 1792 pamphlet ‘An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to use means for the Conversion of the Heathen’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> This led to the establishment of ‘the Baptist Society for propagating the Gospel among the Heathen’ at Kettering, which sent Carey to India in June 1793. A letter home in 1794 prompted ministers from a range of churches in Bristol to think about what they could do to build on his efforts.</p>\n<p>This led to David Bogue, the Scottish Minister of an Independent Church in Gosport, Hampshire, to issue an appeal in the <em>Evangelical Magazine</em>, central to which was a sense of debt and obligation – both to God, and to early missionaries to the British Isles. According to Bogue, the spirit of <em>Justice</em> cried out:</p>\n<p><em>Ye were once Pagans, living in cruel and abominable idolatry. The servants of Jesus came from other lands, and preached His Gospel among you. Hence your knowledge of salvation. And ought ye not, as an equitable compensation for their kindness, to send messengers to the nations which are in like condition with yourselves of old, to entreat them that they turn from their dumb idols to the living God, and wait for His Son from heaven? Verily their debtors ye are.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Missionary activity was imagined in late 18th century Britain as a ‘Gift of Grace’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup><br>\nBut it was understood as a return gift, acknowledging an obligation placed on Christian Britain, ‘once an island of idolatrous barbarians’,  by a gift of the Word received by pagan ancestors, generations previously. As George Burder, an engraver who became a minister in Coventry, put it on the eve of the founding of the Missionary Society in 1795:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Let us in return “go and do likewise”</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure id=\"fig-c1-9\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c1-9\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A historical scene depicting a ritual with participants, traditional huts, palm trees, and a display of skulls in a tropical setting.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-9.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">A Human Sacrifice, in a Morai, in Otaheite (with Captain Cook observing) hand-coloured etching by William Woollett, 1784, after John Webber.

Its constitution declared that ‘The sole object is to spread the knowledge of Christ among heathen and other unenlightened nations’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although its model as a non-denominational society was the <em>Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade</em>, it was neither North America nor Africa that beckoned most strongly. The choice of Tahiti as the first location for missionary activity was influenced by the accounts of Cook’s voyages, which circulated widely, accompanied by prints, some of which were developed from the paintings of Hodges, and others from drawings by John Webber, an artist who accompanied Cook on his third voyage.</p>\n<p>In the years after Cook’s death in 1779, Tahiti became central to the evangelical vision of Thomas Haweis, a Cornish Anglican. Haweis had been chaplain to Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, who had been part of the Methodist evangelical revival during the mid-18th century. She had supported missions in Sierra Leone as well as in North America to both Indigenous Americans as well as formerly enslaved people, and following her death in 1791, Haweis retained considerable influence as her principal trustee.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c1-10\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c1-10\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Map illustrating Captain James Cook's Pacific voyages, detailing routes taken by the Endeavour and Resolution ships between 1768-1779.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-10.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Map of Cook’s Three Voyages showing the location of Tahiti at the centre of the Pacific Ocean</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">With thanks to Astrofella</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Map illustrating Captain James Cook's Pacific voyages, detailing routes taken by the Endeavour and Resolution ships between 1768-1779.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-10.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Map of Cook’s Three Voyages showing the location of Tahiti at the centre of the Pacific Ocean</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">With thanks to Astrofella</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Haweis had previously tried, unsuccessfully, to send missionaries to Tahiti with Captain Bligh, so the establishment of the Missionary Society provided another opportunity. He argued that the main barriers to missionary work: inhospitable climates, absolute governments (as found in China and Japan), the prejudices of false religion (such as Islam), and the difficulty of learning new languages, could most easily be overcome in Tahiti where he thought weather was good, food plentiful, government mild, religious prejudices minimal and the language easy to learn. Haweis personally put up a sum of £500, nearly ten years wages for a skilled tradesman at the time, to fund the mission.</p>\n<p>The problem with starting missionary work at Tahiti, however, is that it lies in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, so is far from easy to get to. The Directors of the society decided to buy a ship, the Duff. Preparations were overseen by Captain Wilson who recruited a crew of twenty-two, including his nephew William Wilson as First Mate. William is shown in the painting standing next to his uncle with his right hand in his waistcoat.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Directors recruited thirty missionaries. They including four ordained ministers, but also a roll of late-eighteenth century trades:  six carpenters, a cabinet maker, two bricklayers, a gardener, a cotton manufacturer, a linen draper, two weavers, two tailors, two shoemakers, a hatter, a shopkeeper, a harness maker, a surgeon, a blacksmith, a cooper, a butcher, and for some reason, a gentleman’s servant. These men had between them six wives and three male children, aged 12, 2 and 16 weeks.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c1-11\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c1-11\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"The missionary ship Duff arrives at Oahu, surrounded by canoes, with excited people waving in a tropical landscape.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-11.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">The missionary ship Duff arriving at Otaheite. colour engraving by J.

By the time the ship left English waters on 24 September, the butcher and his wife, struck down by seasickness, had returned to shore and the twelve-year-old boy, already ill, had died of consumption.</p>\n<p>By mid-November the ship was at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, and having struggled to round Cape Horn, Captain Wilson took an easterly route south of the Cape of Good Hope, Australia and New Zealand before heading north to Tahiti. The missionary ship sailed nearly 14,000 miles in 97 days without sight of land, encountering only one other vessel.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>When the sun rose on Sunday 5 March 1797, the Duff lay off Tahiti. The ship was visited by people in canoes, intent on trading. Trade was refused, it being the Holy day, but they remained on deck to observe a religious service.</p>\n<p>The following day, Captain Wilson landed with a number of others, and was taken by two Swedes who had been living on the island for some years to see a large building at Point Venus in Matavai Bay – built for Captain Bligh and known as the British House. The missionary party returned again the following day to take possession of the house and begin preparing it for the eighteen missionaries as well as their five wives and two children who planned to make it their home.

The presence of children in a painting depicting the birth of a missionary endeavour anticipates the future. The elder child seems to have his gaze directed beyond the frame of the painting, with a finger pointing to something that others do not yet see.</p>\n<p>Ha’amanamani, who had established a formal <em>taiyo</em> exchange relationship with Captain Wilson, of a kind that had become central to the connections of previous European captains such as Cook, is said to have played a prominent role in making these arrangements. He is shown in the painting as a bearded man on the left of the painting in the act of speaking, the object of Wilson’s attention. Although a local priest at the neighbouring island of Mo’orea, he squats in a shaft of light, suggestive of the influence of God.</p>\n<p>In fact, written accounts of the event on 16 March, depicted by the painting, make it clear that Ha’amanamani had his own agenda. Having been exiled from the island of Ra’iatea, he was keen to use his relationship with Wilson to gain access to firearms as well as equipment to fit out the European style ship he was building to invade Ra’iatea. According to Mr Bowell, the shopkeeper,  a rope was stretched around the British house on the day in question to keep the crowd of Tahitians a suitable distance from the missionary party, with Ha’amanamani the only Tahitian to cross the rope.</p>\n<p>He evidently “sat in an odd posture, half bent upon his heels, holding with one hand the rope, and frequently scratching his head and rubbing his eyes with the other”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup>  While this posture is reflected in the painting, the rope is hard to make out in reproductions, but possible to see when standing in front of the painting itself. Ha’amanamani evidently gave a long speech, describing the Gods and important men of the surrounding islands, as well as the European ships and captains that had visited them.</p>\n<p>Ha’amanamani then declared that the missionaries could take the house, trees, fruit and pigs they thought necessary at Matavai, but asked for military support in his campaign to retake Ra’iatea. When this was refused by Captian Wilson, he negotiated for assistance in his shipbuilding efforts, as well as a promise of diplomatic assistance.</p>\n<p>The Directors of the Missionary Society had issued instructions to Captain Wilson in which they declared that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>As an inducement to us to prefer their island, they must give us a full title to the land we may have occasion for, guarantee to us the safety of our property from plunder, the enjoyment of our laws and customs, and the undisturbed exercise of our religion…</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>we recommend that the land shall not be purchased but required, as the condition of us remaining with them: and that the presents we make should not be considered as payments, but as gratuities, the expressions and pledges of our good will.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A gift of grace clearly anticipated significant gifts in return, but the thing that Ha’amanamani was most interested in – European military might – troubled the missionary party.</p>\n<p>This group, shown standing behind Mrs Hassell and the Wilsons, is represented most clearly by the depiction of the carpenter William Henry and his wife, who rather anxiously holds onto his arm, near the front of the group.</p>\n<p>The missionaries are flanked on one side by Peter Haggerstein, one of the Swedes, whose bare chest contrasts with the fuller dress of the missionary party, but whose tattoos, described in written accounts are hard to make out in the painting.</p>\n<p>On their other side the missionary party are framed by the seated figure of Paitia, chief of Matavai. They find their reflection in the group of Tahitians gathered behind Ha’amanamani, representing potential converts. This group also includes two children with their mother, the elder of whom also looks, like the eldest Hassell child, beyond the frame of the image, into the future.</p>\n<p>At the centre of the painting, in a seeming pool of darkness, are two figures, covered from the neck down and sitting on the shoulders of others. These are the young king, Tu (also known as Pomare II), and his wife Tetua, both around twenty years old at the time. The missionaries were surprised to see them carried on land, but happy to bail their own canoes on the water.</p>\n<p>On either side of them are Pomare I and his wife, Itia, who had engaged with Captain Cook and Captain Bligh, and were said to have approved the grant of land at Matavai, when told of the missionaries’ intentions.</p>\n<p>As I looked at the detail of tattoos on the legs of the Tahitian crowd, revealed by the work of museum conservators, I was tempted to see this widescreen image as a snapshot of the meeting of missionaries and Polynesians in 1797. But I had to remind myself of its artefactual nature.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c1-15\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c1-15\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A group of soldiers gathers around a wounded comrade, displaying expressions of concern amidst a dramatic, cloudy battle backdrop.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/1/c1-15.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">The Death of General Wolfe by Benjamin West, 1770.

West’s depiction of a seated Native American is echoed by the seated Tahitians in Smirke’s painting.</p>\n<p>The Cession of Matavai is, however, much closer to West’s subsequent painting, <em>Penn’s Treaty with the Indians</em>, depicting a 1683 event when William Penn entered a peace treaty with Tamanend, Chief of the Lenape.</p>\n<p>The painting was commissioned by Thomas Penn, William’s son, who in 1737 used an unsigned and disputed 1686 deed to claim land extending as far West as a man could walk in a day and a half – the so-called “Walking Purchase”.</p>\n<p>Thomas Penn allegedly hired three men to run on a prepared trail, one of whom managed to cover 70 miles. Displaced from their land by this act of trickery, the Lenape allied with the French and attacked Penn’s Creek in 1755, prompting Benjamin Franklin to establish a militia in what had previously been a pacifist Quaker settlement.</p>\n<p>The image of a peaceful treaty and grant of land, painted nearly ninety years later, was a piece of idealistic propaganda that glossed the more complex history of exploitation, expropriation and violence that followed this hopeful initial moment. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Like <em>Penn’s Treaty with the Indians</em>, the <em>Cession of Matavai</em> is a charter painting, depicting a moment of Christian good faith, while at the same time staking a claim to land, as well as a glorious imagined future. Unlike West’s painting, it was made very soon after the events it depicted. The Duff arrived home in July 1798, and by the end of April 1799 <em>the Cession of Matavai</em> was on display at the Royal Academy in London.</p>\n<p>Looking back from our contemporary vantage point, two and a quarter centuries in the future, we can ask how the future that was anticipated by the painting actually unfolded. How do we now remember British overseas missionary activity of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? How far and how quickly did it depart from its early ideals?</p>\n<p>On 6 March 1798, a year after the missionaries arrived, Tahiti was visited by the Nautilus, a trading vessel from Macao. Missionary efforts to prevent the Captain supplying weapons and gunpowder to the Tahitians angered Tu, engaged in his own campaign of expansion and conquest enabled by his access to European weaponry. In fear of possible reprisals, most of the missionaries, their wives and the children left Tahiti on the Nautilus, bound for Port Jackson, as Sydney, Australia, was known at the time.</p>\n<p>Before the Duff arrived back in London, the Tahiti mission had been reduced to a carpenter, a bricklayer, a cooper, three ministers and a minister’s wife. In late 1798, a second shipload of missionaries set sail for Tahiti in the <em>Duff</em>, but the ship was captured by a French privateer near Rio de Janeiro, and the crew and missionaries offloaded at Montevideo, Uruguay.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/art-artists/exhibition-catalogue/ra-sec-vol31-1799\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Academy catalogue</a> from spring 1799 lists the painting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>_The friendly reception of Captain Wilson, of the Ship Duff, and the persons sent out by the London Missionary Society at Otaheite; and the ceremony of the formal grant of the district of Matavai for their use, in presence of the King, Queen, and Chiefs of that island, March 16.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Only in August 1799, after the Royal Academy exhibition had closed, did news reach London that the majority of missionaries had abandoned Tahiti, and it wasn’t until October that the second group of missionaries managed to find their way back to London from South America.

The “converted Hottentots”, as they were widely known at the time, travelled to the Netherlands with Kicherer in early 1803, visiting England at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>While the concentration of ink and the detail falls on their faces, their dress is lightly sketched to demonstrate it is contemporary European in form. Clothing was an important signifier of civilisation and conversion – the naked <em>Temoteitei</em> had not converted –  but the covered heads of the two women suggest modesty and respectability. Indeed, they present a significant contrast with the way Saartje Baartman was famously presented in London as the “Hottentot Venus”, a mere seven years later.</p>\n<p>Alongside clothing, names also had the power to signify conversion. Mary, John and Martha – familiar Christian names – are inscribed beneath the image. To contemporary evangelicals these names would have recalled the episode in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A38-42&amp;version=KJV\" target=\"_blank\">Luke’s Gospel (10: 38-42)</a> when Martha busied herself with practical preparations to host Jesus, while her sister Mary sat listening to his words.</p>\n<p>The tensions between Christ’s spiritual message and the practical arrangements needed for its transmission dominated early missionary work, so this choice of names was surely deliberate. Indeed, it seems that in South Africa Mary had previously been known as Sara and John as Klaas.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>John the Baptist lived in the desert on locusts and honey, preparing the way for Jesus, but was also Kicherer’s own first name, but is missing from the inscription in favour of his titles “the Revd.

These were initially very much along the lines of a commercial annual report – an account of activity for shareholders, accompanied by a statement of income and expenditure.</p>\n<p>Missionary shareholders were effectively members of the society who subscribed at least a guinea a year, from whom the board of Directors was elected. The Directors constituted a monthly business meeting to supervise the work of the society’s only salaried employee, the secretary.</p>\n<p>In 1803, however, a new publishing venture began, <em>Transactions of the Missionary Society</em>, which made an edited selection of the Society’s correspondence with missionaries available in print – just over 500 pages were included in volume one.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c2-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c2-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-5.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Captain James Wilson and First Mate William Wilson (his nephew) cover page of The Converted HottentotsTract XVI in the Cottage Library of Christian KnowledgeGoogle Books</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-5.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Captain James Wilson and First Mate William Wilson (his nephew) cover page of The Converted HottentotsTract XVI in the Cottage Library of Christian KnowledgeGoogle Books</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>The first volume told the Society’s story from the establishment in 1795 until the end of 1802.

The expansion of Christianity alongside Spanish and Portuguese empires was briefly described, though it was made clear that Protestants would have done a better job.</p>\n<p>Finally, a brief summary was given of recent work by Protestant missionaries – Danes in Greenland and India, Moravians and the Dutch in various parts of the world, and finally the English Baptists, with William Carey in India.</p>\n<p>The focus for the <em>Transactions</em> then shifts to establishment of the Missionary Society in London and its initial focus on the Pacific. <em>The Duff’s</em> capture on its second voyage is described, as well as the abandonment of Tahiti and the way this shook the endeavour ’to its foundation’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> Regardless, missionary work in Tahiti continued, with a reinforcement of eight missionaries arriving in July 1801.</p>\n<p>The account was not confined to the Pacific but also described early missionary efforts in Britain’s remaining North American colonies, subsequently Canada, as well as missionary ambitions for India.

The colony, originally centred around a VOC castle, grew as increasing numbers of Europeans settled at the Cape, taking ever larger tracts of land from its indigenous Khoe and San inhabitants. Stock and crops were raised with forced labour, including that of people enslaved at Madagascar, Mozambique, as well as Dutch colonies in Asia.</p>\n<p>Rivals with the British in the mid-17th century, the Dutch had become allies after 1688 when the Glorious Revolution put William of Orange, a Dutch Protestant King, on the English throne. The 18th century saw the British overtake the Dutch in wealth and maritime supremacy, but in 1780 Dutch support for American rebels led to conflict with Britain that weakened the Dutch Republic.</p>\n<p>In early 1795 an alliance of French forces and Dutch Republicans invaded the Netherlands to establish the Batavian Republic, allied with revolutionary France. Britain, then at war with France, invaded the Cape in mid-1795 to protect its shipping routes, at around the same time the Missionary Society was established back in London.</p>\n<p>The Transactions noted that the Society’s earliest missionaries to Africa went to Sierra Leone in 1797, but war kept them on the coast, where by mid-1798 one had died and the other had been dismissed.</p>\n<p>Although British evangelicals connected West Africa with the evils of the slave trade, they also regarded British control of the Cape as an act of providence that might open the continent to Christianity by another route. The problem was that most people in the Cape colony spoke Dutch, making it a difficult place for British missionaries to work.</p>\n<p>This problem appeared to solve itself when the Directors received a letter in early 1797 from Johannes Theodosius Van der Kemp, who heard about the establishment of the Society and wanted to volunteer. Van der Kemp was a fifty-year-old Edinburgh trained medic and experienced soldier who had become an evangelical Christian after losing his wife and daughter, and nearly losing his own life in a boating accident in 1791.</p>\n<p>Like Captain Wilson before him, Van der Kemp was regarded as sent by God. Working with the Directors, he established the Netherlands Missionary Society in Rotterdam, recruiting another volunteer for mission work, Johannes Kicherer, then in his early twenties.</p>\n<p>At the end of 1798 the two Dutchmen, accompanied by two Englishmen, John Edmonds and William Edwards, departed on the <a href=\"https://www.freesettlerorfelon.com/convict_ship_hillsborough.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Hillsborough</a>, a convict ship bound for Botany Bay, part of the same convoy of ships as the Duff on her calamitous second voyage.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c2-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c2-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A historical page from the April 1799 Evangelical Magazine, featuring an engraved portrait and text about missionary work in Africa.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-7.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Portrait of Rev.

In contrast to regular pitched battles fought in the east of the Cape Colony, this porous frontier with its highly mobile population of indigenous Khoe and San made the expansion of European domination different, but no less violent.</p>\n<p>The central institution of this expanding frontier was the commando, an armed band of farmers of Dutch descent, accompanied by their Khoe servants, who assembled for mutual self-defence. The commando had a great deal in common with what became the ‘posse’ in the American West later in the century, and then as now, when groups of armed and frightened men rode out seeking justice, seemingly defensive actions frequently became offensive actions.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c2-8\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c2-8\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Historic building with a beige facade, prominent columns, arched windows, and a decorative gable, featuring people walking by.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-8.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">South African Sendinggestig Museum. missionary meeting house established in Long Street, Cape Town in 1801 by the South African Missionary Society</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Wikimedia</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Historic building with a beige facade, prominent columns, arched windows, and a decorative gable, featuring people walking by.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-8.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">South African Sendinggestig Museum. missionary meeting house established in Long Street, Cape Town in 1801 by the South African Missionary Society</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Wikimedia</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>While the Cape’s cattle and sheep-herding Khoe peoples had much in common with the similarly pastoralist Dutch frontier farmers, known as trekboers, the San (a Khoe term meaning forager) or as they were widely known in the colony ‘Bushmen’, pursued a way of life that depended predominantly on wild foods.

This so impressed the authorities that he was sent to meet the Governor in Cape Town, who agreed to his proposals. Livestock would be given to them, along with rights to land where they and their children would be safe.</p>\n<p>The idea was that instead of being opposed to colonial expansion, the San should, through the acquisition of property, become part of its pastoral economy, hastening their ‘civilisation’. Macartney encouraged Visser to send San leaders to Cape Town to meet him, where he presumably intended to charm them into cooperating.</p>\n<p>Visser had proposed that ‘captains’ be appointed among the San and given a copper headed staff and brass gorget as a sign of their status – an early method of indirect rule that was partially successful among Khoe groups in the Colony.</p>\n<p>One of the ongoing issues that exacerbated the conflict was that it was very hard to identify recognised leaders with whom to negotiate. The egalitarian nature of San society made it hard for anyone to put themselves forward and receive consistent support from their communities.</p>\n<p>In early 1799, despite the departure of Governor Macartney on health grounds, Visser recruited 187 San men and 284 women and children who were prepared to agree to his proposals, including a number willing to work on Dutch farms, in part because they were literally starving.</p>\n<p><em>T’Karoe,  T’abekom</em> and <em>T’zijib</em> agreed to go to Cape Town following a presentation of gifts that included livestock, beads, knives, tobacco, mirrors, flints and tinder-boxes. According to Van der Kemp, they had been interested by Visser’s prayers and hymns, and wanted to know more about the settlers’ God. It is likely that they had also heard about the Moravian mission at Bavian’s Kloof (now Genadendaal) which had been reestablished in 1792 and was rapidly becoming a refuge for dispossessed Khoe within the colony.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c2-11\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c2-11\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A hand grips a polished brass-handled cane adorned with a crest, set against a lush green lawn background.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-11.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Kaptein Koopman’s staff from Genadendal in 1814, showing the British coat of arms</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Held at the Genadendal Mission Museum</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A hand grips a polished brass-handled cane adorned with a crest, set against a lush green lawn background.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-11.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Kaptein Koopman’s staff from Genadendal in 1814, showing the British coat of arms</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Held at the Genadendal Mission Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"fig-c2-12\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c2-12\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Map of the Western Cape province in South Africa, showcasing geographical features, cities, and neighboring provinces.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-12.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Map showing geographical features of the Western Cape. locations of CapeTown, Stellenbosch and the Roggeveld Mountains marked</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">FreeWorldMaps</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Map of the Western Cape province in South Africa, showcasing geographical features, cities, and neighboring provinces.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-12.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Map showing geographical features of the Western Cape. locations of CapeTown, Stellenbosch and the Roggeveld Mountains marked</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">FreeWorldMaps</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Without explaining any of this background, the <em>Transactions</em> picked up the story with the missionaries travelling to the inland settlement of Roodezand, guided by Bruntjie, a Khoe elephant hunter from Baviaan’s Kloof. From there, Van der Kemp and Edmonds travelled to the East in their wagon with Bruntjie, while Kicherer and Edwards waited for a promised wagon to take them to ‘Bushmanland’.</p>\n<p>They managed to recruit a local man of Dutch descent by the name of Kramer, as well as Willem Fortuin, of mixed Khoe descent, as well as his wife who spoke ‘the Boschemen’s language’, to join them later – the Transactions declared that ‘so mercifully the Lord seemed preparing their way unto the Gentiles’.[13]</p>\n<p>From Roodezand, the missionaries travelled for a week to Visser’s farm, and from there another two weeks into ‘Bushmanland’, accompanied by five wagons, sixty oxen, two hundred sheep and around fifty people. There they established a small missionary settlement at what they named <em>Blydevooruitzigt Fontein</em>, which the <em>Transactions</em> translated as Happy Prospects Fountain. Its two springs gave it the potential for permanent settlement, including a garden planned to recall a plentiful Eden in the midst of this arid land.</p>\n<p>When the farmers left, Visser’s son stayed to help and his knowledge of |Xam, the language spoken the local San, was invaluable until Fortuin and his wife arrived. Other linguistic tensions plagued the mission, however, and when San joined the settlement, they were divided into two groups – one to learn English with Edwards and the other Dutch with Kicherer. Not long afterwards Edwards took his ‘English’ congregation to live separately.</p>\n<p>By November 1799, Kicherer reported in a letter quoted in the Transactions that they had between 30 and 40 ‘Bushmen’ living at the mission, although he noted in a slightly exasperated tone that numbers had been higher, but ‘they wander to and fro’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>While there were signs of interest in Christianity among the San, Kicherer worried that many residents at the mission were more focused on his regular gifts of tobacco – a quarter pipe after attending each service.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup> Concerned about rapidly depleting supplies, Kicherer took nine San to Cape Town in January 1800 to ask for additional support from the Governor.</p>\n<p>His letter to the Directors following his return in March, suggests he was deeply conflicted, seeking to convince himself he was doing God’s work among ‘the most savage and ferocious of all the people who are known in this country’, but constantly worrying about the meagre and extremely insecure practical arrangements on which his mission depended.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> He described his ‘separation from civilised society’ and the distance from his family and friends as an open wound that grows every day.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup></p>\n<p>As a relatively young man of twenty five, he was strongly tempted to accept the offer of a post as minister to one of the settler communities in the colony.

Despite his apparent initial enthusiasm for the missionaries, ‘Vigilant’ later told a local farmer who arrested him that he couldn’t abide the Dutch living in his country.</p>\n<p>When Kicherer returned to the troubled mission with another recruit and a stronger mandate from the Governor, Edwards left to try his luck with Van der Kemp in the East of the Colony. When a group of San attempted to shoot Kicherer with poisoned arrows, he decided to relocate the mission to the Zak River, nearer the Colony, where he might receive greater protection from the colonists.</p>\n<p>At this point, the so-called ‘Bushman Mission’ seems to have shifted its focus from the San to people of Khoe descent, many of whom had lived and worked on Dutch farms and were more interested in becoming Christians.<br>\nAt the end of 1800 additional missionary recruits arrived in South Africa and one of them, William Anderson joined Kicherer when he was once again visiting Cape Town.</p>\n<p>In May 1801, less than two years after commencing the mission, Kicherer led his followers across Bushmanland to the less arid region near the Gariep, or ‘great river’ in the North, where Anderson had gone ahead to establish a mission to the Coranna, or Orlam, a Khoe group that had left the colony.</p>\n<p>It is with a letter from William Anderson dated 6 December 1801 describing this seeming abandonment of the mission to the San that the first volume <em>Transactions</em> ends its account of work on the northern frontier of the Cape Colony, although quite a bit of space was also given to Van der Kemp’s attempts to establish a mission among Xhosa-speakers further East.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c2-14\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c2-14\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An individual dressed in traditional attire, holding a curved staff and adorned with ornamental headgear and a cape.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-14.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">A Bosjesman in Armour by Samuel Daniell.

The visual distinction in his sketch map between the rectilinear houses of the ‘Baptised Hottentots’ and the circular structures of the ‘unbaptised Hottentots’ make a similar categorical distinction based on conversion.</p>\n<p>Kicherer compared San huts to pig styes and found their practice of smearing animal fat and pigment onto their bodies disgusting. He was shocked by examples of domestic violence and infanticide, and his descriptions of the degradation of the San provided a backdrop for the ‘Providence of God’ which called them to the fellowship of the Gospel and rendered them ‘the distinguished trophies of his almighty grace’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup></p>\n<p>In religious terms, Kicherer suggested that the San:</p>\n<p><em>have no idea whatever of the Supreme Being… practice no kind of worship’ having only ‘a superstitious reverence of a little insect known by the name the Creeping-leaf, a sight of which, they conceive, indicates something fortunate, and to kill it, they suppose, will bring a curse upon the perpetrator</em></p>\n<p>An 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum would quote Kicherer’s words in its caption for a praying mantis that was displayed there as ‘the Hottentot’s God’, a name retained in contemporary Afrikaans.</p>\n<p>This detail, as well as Kicherer’s account of healing ceremonies involving ‘men… employed to blow, and make a humming over the sick, which they sometimes continue for many hours together’ fits well with later descriptions of San ceremonial practices across southern Africa.

He suggested that ‘Boschemen… when approaching a white man for the first time… appear in an agony of fear, which discovers itself by the trembling of every limb.’ <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup></p>\n<p>Those who travelled to Cape Town were struck with dread and dismay when they saw men hung in chains for atrocious crimes, as well as when they witnessed a public execution, although Kicherer attempted to make these things object lessons in European justice as an ordinance of God.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c2-17\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c2-17\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An illustration of a Mantis, labeled Mantis, the Soothsayer, featuring detailed descriptions and context about the insect.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-17.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Mantis, the Soothsayer.

He describes how he gave names to the San who joined the mission, and wrote these across their shoulders in chalk. When they approached him, the first thing they did was turn to show him their backs. His regular trips to the Cape seem to have been motivated, at least partly, by attempts to get hold of European style clothes to dress his congregation, to replace the sheep skins he described as ‘filthy karosses’.</p>\n<p>An account of Kicherer’s testimony to a congregation in London in November 1803 makes it clear that the ‘Hottentot converts’ were intended to illustrate a contrast with the way in which they were reported to have lived before conversion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When these poor Africans are enlightened, a great change takes place in their outward conduct and appearance. Those who before were almost naked, clothe themselves with decency; – from being extremely filthy, they learn to be clean; – and from that laziness which prevailed among them while Heathens, they learn to be diligent, and to cultivate the earth for their subsistence. Thus while the gospel brings to them a spiritual salvation, it becomes also the mean of civilising, we might almost say, of humanising them; and this affords an additional argument for Missionary zeal.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When questioned in front of a congregation with Kicherer acting as translator and mediator, there were few in London who doubted the sincerity of Martha, Mary and John’s conversion and their conviction in the saving grace of Christ. However, there seems to have been a degree of slight of hand in their presentation as the straightforward results of missionary work, alongside these accounts of ‘wild Bushmen’.</p>\n<p>While John van Rooij called himself a ‘pure Hottentot’, both Mary, whose maiden name was Fortuin, and Martha Arendse were regarded in the Cape as ‘Bastaard-Hottentots’, the children of one Khoe parent and one enslaved Malay parent. Mary had worked at the tobacco plantation where Kicherer bought his tobacco, and left this employment to join the mission. Martha had worked as a servant for a Dutch family, but left to join the mission where she was employed by Kicherer as his house-keeper.</p>\n<p>Familiar with the social distinctions established within the Colony over the previous century and a half, all three would have recognised that being Christian, as well as promising other-worldly salvation, enhanced one’s status in this world.</p>\n<p>There were many in the colony who were extremely suspicious of Kicherer’s missionary work, with its emphasis on salvation and education – a view that reasserted itself when the Cape returned to Dutch control in 1803. Martin Hinrich Lichtenstein was a young German doctor and naturalist who arrived at the Cape with General Janssens, the governor appointed by the the Batavian Republic.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c2-18\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c2-18\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Historical illustration of Kicherer's Missionary Institute, featuring tents, livestock, and figures engaged in various activities.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-18.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Kicherer’s Missionary Institute at the Sack-rivers gatepublished in Hinrich Lichtenstein’s 1812 Travels in Southern Africa in the Years, 1803, 1804, 1805 and 1806.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">New York Public Library</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Historical illustration of Kicherer's Missionary Institute, featuring tents, livestock, and figures engaged in various activities.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-18.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Kicherer’s Missionary Institute at the Sack-rivers gatepublished in Hinrich Lichtenstein’s 1812 Travels in Southern Africa in the Years, 1803, 1804, 1805 and 1806.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">New York Public Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>In mid-1805 Lichtenstein was sent to investigate the conditions in Bushmanland and visited Kicherer’s mission at Zak river, of which he noted ‘so much boasting has been made by himself and his friends in Europe’ – an image of the settlement was made for the English edition of Lichtenstein’s account.</p>\n<p>Lichtenstein suggested that both Kicherer and Van der Kemp ‘seemed wholly to forget that mankind was destined to work as well as to pray’. In Kicherer’s absence those remaining at the mission had become dejected, and he claimed were generally ‘Bastard-Hottentots: several of them were entirely white; and the greater part had been baptised before they came hither; some were even born of christian parents’.</p>\n<p>Lichtenstein went as far as to claim that Mary, Martha and John had been baptised at Cape Town by a preacher called Fleck long before they even met Kicherer. While acknowledging that people at the mission had been instructed in Christianity, Lichtenstein asserted that ‘the fact is, that they would have been much better employed in the service of the colonists, providing for their wants by industry, than pursuing, as they did here, lives wholly useless, and abandoned to sloth’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Kicherer arrived back at the Cape in early 1805, Governor Janssens proclaimed a new policy: missions could be established beyond the boundaries of the colony, but must have no communication with its inhabitants, who were prohibited from attending missionary schools. Missionaries were specifically prohibited from recruiting anyone from the service of their masters – no one working for a colonist or who had worked for a colonist in the past year could join a mission.</p>\n<p>With the boundaries of the colony redrawn to include both Kicherer and Van der Kemp’s missions, it was declared that these could remain, but were prohibited from teaching writing. Instead they were encouraged to concentrate on training people to cultivate the land. Finally, missionary settlements were only allowed to offer prayers for the Batavian Republic and the Cape Colony.</p>\n<p>Returning to the Zak River in October 1805 Kicherer found the river had dried up and the mission’s main supporter among the farmers, Floris Visser, had died. A San raid carried off 200 sheep the following month, prompting the newly married Kicherer to conclude that he was, after all, called to become a Government appointed minister in the colonial town of Graaff-Reinet.</p>\n<p>In 1806, less than three years after Mary, John and Martha visited London, and just as the British resumed their control of the Cape, the Zak River Mission was abandoned.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c2-19\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c2-19\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"White colonial-style building with green doors, featuring a grand staircase and an arched entrance framed by trees.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-19.jpeg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Reinet House, the Old Pastornow a Museum, built as a parsonage for Kicherer by the Cape government, using the labour of enslaved people.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Wikimedia</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"White colonial-style building with green doors, featuring a grand staircase and an arched entrance framed by trees.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/2/c2-19.jpeg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Reinet House, the Old Pastornow a Museum, built as a parsonage for Kicherer by the Cape government, using the labour of enslaved people.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Wikimedia</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2><strong>Notes</strong></h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Jensz, Felicity, and Hanna Acke. “The Form and Function of Nineteenth-Century Missionary Periodicals: Introduction.” <em>Church History</em> 82, no. 2 (2013): 368-73. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0009640713000036\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1017/s0009640713000036</a>. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Sivasundaram, Sujit. _Nature and the Godly Empire : Science and Evangelical Mission in the Pacific, 1795-1850._Cambridge Social and Cultural Histories ; 7.

An immobile spectre, this towering creature dominated the museum across three locations and nearly fifty years.</p>\n<p>But how did it come to occupy this imposing position, and who was ultimately responsible for its killing, preservation and transportation to Europe?</p>\n<p>On 24 June 1812, the Rev. John Campbell, a forty-six-year-old Congregational Minister from Scotland, boarded the Isabella convict transport ship at Gravesend in Kent, bound for Africa.</p>\n<p>Formerly an ironmonger in Edinburgh, Campbell had been interested in Africa for decades – he had campaigned for the abolition of the slave trade, and was a friend of John Newton, the former slave trader who penned <em>Amazing Grace</em>.</p>\n<p>Campbell had been the motivating force behind the <em>Society for the Education of Africans</em>, hoping that schooling in Britain might convert young Africans through Grace and the Gospel, enabling them to return and transform their home countries.</p>\n<p>Leading Anglicans feared the impact of an Edinburgh education, resolving in 1799 that the 20 boys and 4 girls sent from Sierra Leone ‘should remain in safety from contamination with any heretical or socialistic ideals’, at an <em>African Academy</em> in Clapham, London.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ordained the minister of Kingsland Chapel in London in early 1804, Campbell met <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/2-the-revd-mr-kicherer-mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Martha, Mary and John, the South African visitors</a>, shortly after they arrived with Rev.

Van der Kemp had been in the process of preparing to launch a mission to Madagascar, where his very young formerly enslaved wife originally came from.</p>\n<p>The missionaries’ advocacy for the indigenous Khoisan people of the Cape, and the attention they had drawn to their abusive treatment by local farmers, had come to a head, and the Cape government was in the process of launching a commission to investigate their charges.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>What is more, Hinrich Lichtenstein had just published the English translation of his <em>Travels in Southern Africa between the years 1803 and 1806</em>, which included extremely unflattering descriptions of both van der Kemp and his missionary settlement Bethelsdorp.</p>\n<p>This reflected suspicion among the settlers of what they called <em>Bedelaarsdorp</em> (Beggar’s village), partly due to the reluctance of its residents to labour on local farms.</p>\n<p>Lichtenstein ridiculed both Van der Kemp’s adoption of local forms of dress, such as leather sandals, and questioned the marriages of both Van der Kemp and his fellow Bethelsdorp missionary, James Read, to extremely young non-white women.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>Campbell was tasked with visiting the mission stations in Africa to investigate.

The Cape Colony had returned to British control in 1806 following a naval invasion during the Napoleonic wars, so Britain’s 1807 Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade applied there, at least in theory. Slavery, but also the trade in enslaved people, continued to operate however, and Campbell witnessed domestic slavery first hand at the Cape.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c3-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c3-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Illustration of various household utensils, ornaments, and tools of the Aboriginal people, featuring unique designs and shapes.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/3/c3-3.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Household Utensils, Ornaments, and Weapons of the Beetjuans.

Established in 1738, it was abandoned for fifty years before being re-established in 1792.</p>\n<p>Campbell visited the homes of the indigenous Khoekhoen families living at these missions, remarking on their cleanliness as well as their ‘mostly decent’ dress, while noticing that some still dressed in loose sheepskins.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> Echoing Lichtenstein’s description of the orderliness of these settlements, he nevertheless wrote down frightful stories about encounters with African animals, including a leopard attack.</p>\n<p>It was not until mid-February 1813 that Campbell set off to inspect the Society’s own mission stations, going first to Bethelsdorp at Algoa Bay in the eastern Cape, Van der Kemp’s mission since 1803.</p>\n<p>Travelling from Cape Town with two wagons, drawn by teams of twelve and fourteen oxen, Campbell was almost entirely reliant on the expertise and know-how of his Khoekhoen guides.</p>\n<p>The party was overseen by Cupido Kakkerlak (Cupid Cockroach in Afrikaans), who Campbell called the group’s ‘travelling director’,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> a Khoe preacher from Bethelsdorp who had been baptised by Van der Kemp in 1801.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>In addition ‘Britannia’, a Gonaqua man, drove the other wagon, while ‘John’ and ‘Michael’ led the oxen and ‘Elizabeth’ and ‘Sarah’ took care of cooking, washing, finding water as well as making regular coffees for the travelling party.</p>\n<p>During the month long journey, Campbell formed an attachment to his companions, writing that they were:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>far from being so barbarous a race as they are usually supposed to be by Europeans… They have nothing more savage about them than the peasants in England. I have seen families in London living in more dirty hovels than ever I saw Hottentots, and many in London have committed far more atrocious deeds than any I have ever heard the Hottentots charged with.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>I think the Hottentot mind is better cultivated than the minds of many in the lower ranks in London; and I should expect to be much better served, and to be more safe in travelling with twenty Hottentots, than with twenty Europeans.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The mission at Bethelsdorp was a rare place where Khoekhoen could live a fairly independent life within the colony, apart from when pressed to serve in the Cape Regiment – the majority of Khoekhoe not living at missions were forced to work as farm labourers. Vocational training seems to have been a strand at the mission, and William Corner, a Black missionary from Demerara, a Dutch colony in the Caribbean, had been training carpentry apprentices for around a year when Campbell arrived.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c3-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c3-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An engraved portrait of a man in a coat and tie, framed in an oval, with the inscription Cyphers, Assistant Evangelist, dated 1818.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/3/c3-5.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Cupido Kakkerlak.

Tzatzoe presented Campbell with a wooden box he had made in the cabinet maker’s style ‘for containing any varieties I might happen to obtain higher up in Africa’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Campbell was definitely not as impressed by the physical appearance of Bethelsdorp as he had been by Genadendal – he compared its irregularity to Norwich or Manchester – some houses having been abandoned. The lack of water supply also meant there weren’t any trees or gardens. He was equally unimpressed by the fact that many people still dressed in animal skins, but blamed Van der Kemp, suggesting he ‘seems to have judged it necessary, rather to imitate the savage in appearance, than to induce the savage to imitate him’! ⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c3-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c3-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A historical illustration of Bethelsdorp, depicting scattered huts and a winding stream amidst rolling hills and mountainous backdrop.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/3/c3-6.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Bethelsdorp image published opposite p.70 in John Campbell’s 1815 Travels in South Africa</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Scanned from the author’s personal collection</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A historical illustration of Bethelsdorp, depicting scattered huts and a winding stream amidst rolling hills and mountainous backdrop.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/3/c3-6.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Bethelsdorp image published opposite p.70 in John Campbell’s 1815 Travels in South Africa</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Scanned from the author’s personal collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Visiting farms a mile and a half away, however, Campbell was impressed by the amount of cultivated land and when describing the Bethelsdorp cattle herd, stated that he had never seen so many beasts in one place apart from at Smithfield market in London.</p>\n<p>Cupido, who had been born around 1760 grew up on a farm, and did his time as a farm labourer. However, he became a key figure among the founders of Betheldorp, when land had been allocated for the mission by Batavian authorities in 1803-4.</p>\n<p>At Bethelsdorp, Cupido worked for himself as a sawyer and wood trader, while his wife made soap for sale. Together they built up a herd of ten oxen and purchased a wagon. The church became increasingly important in Cupido’s life, and he was one of the first people at the mission to learn to read and write.</p>\n<p>While he thought there was still room for improvement, Campbell concluded that during its first decade Bethelsdorp had become a self-sustaining Christian community of around a thousand people, with over two thousand cattle. A significant measure of this, in Campbell’s eyes, was the money they raised to support the poor and sick, as well as missionary work elsewhere.</p>\n<p>From Bethelsdorp, a party of five wagons set off in April 1813, intent on examining potential mission sites in Albany, recently cleared of its human inhabitants by a combination of Khoekhoen and British troops during the fourth frontier war of 1811-12. It was while travelling through this recently depopulated landscape that Campbell first encountered large African mammals such as elephants and buffaloes.</p>\n<p>It was the thirty Khoekhoen in the party, however, including two who had originally been part of the Zak River mission [<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/2-the-revd-mr-kicherer-mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a>], who did all the hunting, at times mounted on oxen. They skinned and cut up animals to make biltong (preserved meat) and presented Campbell with various trophies, including the horns of the first buffalo they shot. Somewhere along the way, Campbell seems to have acquired his own sheepskin cloak or kaross, which he appreciated on cold nights.</p>\n<p>Arriving at Graaf-Reinet at the end of April, Campbell met <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/2-the-revd-mr-kicherer-mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Kicherer, Martha, Mary and John</a>, but also William Burchell, a young botanist and collector who travelled in the interior of South Africa between June 1811 and April 1815.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c3-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c3-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A muscular man stands in traditional attire, draped in a fur cloak, holding a spear, against a textured background.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/3/c3-7.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Klaas.

I have been informed that a skin of the Camelopard which was shot in that country where I am going to, was sold in England for fifteen hundred pounds and though I cannot hope that if I bring one home it will sell for half that sum, yet should I be so fortunate as to discover the Unicorn, which has been supposed to exist in this part of Africa, I have not the least doubt of making five times that sum.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Discussed in the same breath as the unicorn, the giraffe had until recently been considered a quasi-mythical beast in Europe, known from Classical texts that described it as camel-like with the skin markings of a leopard – hence camel-leopard.</p>\n<p>The first skin and skeleton to arrive in England had been collected at the Cape in the late 1770s by William Paterson, another Scotsman, and was presented by his patron Lady Strathmore to John Hunter, whose anatomy collections became the Hunterian Museum at London’s Royal College of Surgeons.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At around the same time Robert Jacob Gordon, a Dutch born soldier from the Scotch brigade, sent a giraffe skin to Holland, and a few years later the French traveller François Le Vaillant sent another to Paris that ended up in the Natural History Museum in Paris.</p>\n<p>Burchell had initially travelled into the interior from Cape Town with missionaries, using the Society’s stations as the stopping points on his journey. Like Campbell, he was dependent on Khoekhoen guides and key among them was Stoffel Speelman, recently discharged from the Cape Regiment.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Like Cupido, Speelman took charge of the practical aspects of the journey, finding water for the cattle and doing most of the hunting – for food as well as Natural History collecting. Burchell trained his assistants to cut and remove skins in a way that would enable subsequent taxidermy. In a journal entry, Burchell stated that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In order to encourage Speelman in being diligent to shoot birds for my collection I have promised him a rix dollar for every dozen skins I preserve: And to whoever shall bring down a camelopardalis, any thing of my bartering goods he may choose.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Burchell and Speelman twice made the dangerous journey on the route they pioneered between Graaf Reinet and Klaarwater, across so-called ‘Bushmanland’, and Campbell intended to follow in their footsteps.</p>\n<p>At Graaf-Reinet, Burchell advised Campbell, but also agreed that one of his party could join them as a guide. How much they discussed Natural History collecting is unclear, but Burchell’s wagons must have already been impressively full, since he collected a total of 63,000 items during his travels.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Campbell’s party of three wagons and numerous livestock and dogs completed this journey in early June 1813 when they crossed what he called the ‘Great River’, later known as the Orange, and now mostly called the Gariep, a transliteration of the Khoe words Kai !Garib, meaning ‘great river’.</p>\n<p>Campbell’s published account of the journey describes them entering what he called ‘Griqualand’, but at the time was no such thing. The people they were on their way to see called themselves ‘Bastaard Hottentoten’ or just plain ‘Bastaards’, in acknowledgement of their mixed ancestry.</p>\n<p>During his visit, Campbell persuaded them to abandon this term on account of “the offensiveness of the word to an English or Dutch ear”, and to rename themselves Griqua, since the Khoekhoen group they were most descended from was the “Gurigriqua”.They also renamed Klaarwater (Clear Water), their main settlement, Griqua Town – now mostly known as Griekwastad.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The settlement was dominated at the time by the Kok and Barends families, fugitives from the expanding Cape Colony, who prospered by trading and raiding across the frontier. The advantages that guns and horses gave them over other residents of the African interior were considerable.</p>\n<p>A mission had been established at Kok’s kraal in 1802, but relocated along with the people to Klaarwater shortly afterwards. By 1813 Campbell recorded a population of around 1300 Griquas, with another 1300 Corannas (another mixed Khoekhoen group) under their protection.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c3-9\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c3-9\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A detailed illustration of a giraffe standing upright, showcasing its long neck and patterned coat against a light background.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/3/c3-9.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">John Hunter’s giraffe (c. 1780)</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Original watercolour painting held among the Hunterian drawings in the Library of the Royal College of Surgeons, London.

The image derived from a drawing made by none other than William Burchell, who had given it to William Anderson. Anderson was a missionary of the Society who had worked in the region since 1801.</p>\n<p>Burchell was extremely surprised and somewhat upset when he finally arrived back in Cape Town in 1815 and found that the drawing had not only been sent to England, but that it had found its way into Campbell’s account as a print, with no acknowledgment of its original source.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Another pair of drawings, made by Burchell at Klaarwater in December 1811, show a giraffe skin propped up on a wooden scaffold in the midst of houses at the settlement, presumably in the process of being preserved for Burchell’s collection.</p>\n<p>Although Campbell first saw giraffes while approaching the Orange River in June 1813, it was only at the end of July, following his return from a visit to Tswana settlements further north, that his party successfully shot one near Griqua Town.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup> While writing letters back to London, Campbell heard musket shots and was fetched by a messenger who told him that the hunters wanted him to see the giraffe before it died.</p>\n<p>When he arrived, it had already collapsed, but Campbell was amazed by its height, suggesting that a high horse could have walked between its legs. Presented with the skin to take to England by the person who shot it, presumably inspired by Burchell’s keenness on acquiring a similar skin a year before, Campbell happily added it to his collection.</p>\n<p>In the days that followed, Campbell was gratified when the newly constituted ‘Griqua’, having agreed to a code of laws, system of justice and his proposal they should adopt their own currency, decided to rename one of their satellite settlements Campbell in his honour.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Following the Gariep downstream before travelling south through Namaqualand, Campbell’s party arrived back at Cape Town at the very end of 1813.</p>\n<p>Meeting John Craddock, the Governor of the colony early in the new year, Campbell was granted additional land for a new mission in Albany which he optimistically named Theopolis, the city of God.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Returning to Britain, Campbell arrived at Plymouth in May 1814, and immediately began speaking and preaching about his journey – the giraffe skin was sent to the London taxidermist Benjamin Leadbeater for preparation.</p>\n<p>Early in 1815, Campbell published an account of his journey – the frontispiece of which shows its diminutive author sheltering from the African sun under an umbrella in a pose reminiscent of the contemporary ‘selfie’.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c3-12\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c3-12\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Four Griqua Town coins displayed: denominations 1/4, 1/2, 5, and 10, featuring an eagle design on one side.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/3/c3-12.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Griqua Town coinsMinted by the Directors of the London Missionary Society in January 1816</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Wikipedia</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Four Griqua Town coins displayed: denominations 1/4, 1/2, 5, and 10, featuring an eagle design on one side.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/3/c3-12.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Griqua Town coinsMinted by the Directors of the London Missionary Society in January 1816</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Wikipedia</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"fig-c3-13\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c3-13\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A man in Victorian attire holds a green umbrella, pointing while standing outdoors near a river and grazing cattle.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/3/c3-13.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Frontispieceby Henry Meyer, after William Thomas Strutt.

Members and friends of the society were invited to apply for a ticket to visit on Tuesday and Thursdays between 11am and 3pm from any of the Directors.</p>\n<p>There, they would be able to gaze upwards at the towering giraffe, a decade before the first living giraffe made its way to the British Isles.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> A further note was added, soliciting further donations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Ladies and gentlemen, possessed of any curious articles suited to this collection, and disposed to part with them, will greatly oblige the Society by presenting them to the Directors to enrich their Museum.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In April 1816 ‘idols of silver’ and copper arrived for the museum from Ballari in Karnataka, South India. In September, further ‘valuable curiosities’ from South Africa were announced.</p>\n<p>These had been sent by Rev. Mr George Thom, who had travelled to South Africa with Campbell on his way to a missionary posting in Calcutta, but had been asked to remain in Cape Town as the Missionary Society’s agent. These items included:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>skins of a large lion, tyger, leopard, ant-eater, wild boar, lynx, goo, spring buck, kangaroo. &amp; C.; together with various kinds of serpents – the puff-adder, the camelion and La Masité (commonly called The Hottentot’s God).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though most of these items, like the giraffe, spoke more to South Africa’s natural history than to its religious state, the Afrikaans name for the praying mantis made it clear that the religious understandings of southern African people were not unrelated to the country’s wild creatures.</p>\n<p>Soon afterwards ‘London’ was appended to the Missionary Society’s official name, partly to distinguish it from the Anglican Church Missionary Society, established in 1799. However, this choice of name also seems to have connected to the Society’s acquiring a physical headquarters with an attached museum in the city.</p>\n<p>In September 1817, following his return to London, William Burchell presented 43 animals skins, including a pair of giraffes, not to the Missionary Museum but to the British Museum. Upset by the way in which the skins were subsequently neglected and allowed to decay, he complained and a number were eventually prepared for display.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c3-16\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c3-16\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An illustration of a mantis with detailed anatomical features, accompanied by text discussing its significance in the Hottentot culture.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/3/c3-16.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Mantis, the Soothsayer.

It is remarkable for the great disproportion of height between the fore and hind parts. The head is like that of a Stag; the neck is slender; the tail long, with strong hairs at the end; the whole is of a dirty white, marked with large broad rusty spots. It is very timid, but not swift; it runs awkwardly, and is easily taken. It browses on trees, yet can feed on the grass, and drinks water from the brook. Its height is from fifteen to seventeen feet, but some have been seen more than twenty feet. The specimen is about sixteen feet.</em></p>\n<p><em>The Giraffe was known to the Romans in early times. It appears among the figures in the assemblage of eastern animals in the celebrated Praenestine Pavement, made by the direction of Sylla, and is represented both grazing and browsing, in its natural attitudes. It was exhibited at Rome by the popular Caesar, among other animals, in the Circasean Games.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While classical knowledge of giraffes was recalled in this catalogue description, the detailed practical knowledge of hunters such as Stoffel Speelman and Cupido Kakkerlak, as well as their central role directing the journeys undertaken by both Campbell and Burchell, was essentially obscured from view when these giraffes were displayed in London.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>John Griscom, <em>A year in Europe: comprising a journal of observations in England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Switzerland, the north of Italy, and Holland.

Yearning to become a missionary, he trained for a year, was ordained and then married – the risks of sending unmarried missionaries into the world having now been recognised.</p>\n<p>Mary Mercy Moor, his wife, had been orphaned as a child but was inspired to become a missionary after hearing Campbell speak about his journey in London. As a young woman, however, the only way viable way to embark on a life as a missionary in 1815 was as a missionary wife. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The voyage took the pair via Rio de Janeiro, where they arrived at the same time as a slave ship from Africa, its deck crowded with people of a similar age. But William and Mary were not slaves or convicts, and their journey marked the commencement of another sort of life.</p>\n<p>Waiting in New South Wales for onward transport to Tahiti, they stayed at Parramatta with the Hassells, the original missionary family <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-cession-of-matavai/\" target=\"_blank\">depicted in the Cession of Matavai</a>, who had left Tahiti in 1798.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was here that they would have heard of the arrival in Sydney harbour of the Queen Charlotte, a ship that traded with the islands, until recently captained by William Shelley, another former missionary from the first Duff voyage.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Alongside sandalwood and pork, another, extremely unusual, cargo was unloaded – ‘nailed up in a case’ by missionaries at Tahiti. It was addressed to Joseph Hardcastle, Treasurer of the Missionary Society in London, and was making William and Mary’s journey in reverse.</p>\n<p>We have to imagine the wooden packing case being carried into the Parramatta home of Samuel Marsden, the penal colony’s senior churchman, who two years previously had begun a mission to New Zealand under the aegis of the Anglican Church Missionary Society. We don’t know who pulled the nails out of the case, but it is likely to have been one of the many convicts who worked for Marsden, herding sheep on the thousands of acres of Australian bush, granted to Marsden by the governor.</p>\n<p>William and Mary Ellis had likely gazed up at <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Campbell’s giraffe</a> in the newly opened Missionary Museum in London a year before, but the artefacts revealed in Parramatta – carved from wood and whale bone and bound with colourful feathers – were unlike any they had seen. In a letter to Hardcastle, dated 31 October 1816, Marsden described them as ‘THE IDOL GODS OF OTAHEITE’:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;They are now lying prostrate on the table before me; and were we not certain of the fact, we could not believe that any human beings could place their salvation in these wretched images, and offer up human sacrifices to avert their anger</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>Whether this Halloween display was deliberate on Marsden’s part is hard to know from a distance of two centuries, but the date’s significance could not have been lost on the many Irish rebels transported to the penal colony. How the superstitious sailors of the Willerby, the ship on which Marsden forwarded the case to London, regarded these ‘idol gods’ can only be imagined, but when the ship was wrecked off Ambon Island, in what is now Indonesia, there must have been some who blamed this ominous cargo.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>News of these ‘Idol Gods’ reached London in early 1818.

He had been upset when missionaries tried to prevent a visiting ship supplying him with guns and powder and had a number of them publicly stripped.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards Tu’s father, Pomare I, under whose protection the remaining seven missionaries placed themselves, tried to enlist their support in his military efforts.</p>\n<p>Politically, the situation at Tahiti was unstable, with conflict emerging between father and son. In November 1798, when Tu supported the execution of his ally, the priest Ha’amanamani who had arranged the settlement of missionaries at Matavai a year before, it was recorded of Tu in the missionary journal that:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;We believe he is capable of committing any wickedness the devil, his carnal mind, and bloodthirsty followers may excite him to, if God did not restrain him.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup></em></p>\n<p>In January 1800, much to the disapproval of the missionaries, his father, Pomare I, acquired a ‘a carronade, two swivels, several muskets and a great deal of ammunition’ from a visiting ship, from which four sailors also deserted to assist him.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup></p>\n<p>In July 1801, the mission was reinforced with eight new missionaries as well as one who had previously been at Tonga, arriving with a fresh supply of stores.</p>\n<p>In 1802, Henry Nott, a bricklayer had remained at Tahiti since the arrival of the Duff in 1797, began preaching around the island, having developed sufficient command of Tahitian. It was during his preaching tour that Nott visited the <em>marae</em> or sacred place of Oro the god of war at Atahuru.</p>\n<p>Here, Tu seized the <em>to’o</em> or representation of the God, described by the missionaries as a ‘billet of wood’, initiating a conflict that pitted him once more against his father.</p>\n<p>Conflict and violence spiralled across the island, accompanied by death and disease, and it was at around this time that Tu began to show an interest in missionary’ preaching.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c4-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c4-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A vibrant watercolor depicting a serene landscape with palm trees, huts, and figures engaged in activities on the island of Oahu in 1792.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/4/c4-7.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">The marae at Pare, looking towards Matavai, Tahiti in 1792.

These included deploying the military expertise of mutineers from the Bounty during the late 1780s to establish their preeminence. The missionaries, however, understood their suffering as God’s judgement for the impieties of the Tahitians.</p>\n<p>In September 1803 Pomare I died, changing the calculus of Tahitian politics.</p>\n<p>Adopting the name Pomare II, Tu consolidated his position with advice from a Hawaiian courtier, recently returned from Europe. He began learning to read and write and attempted to persuade the missionaries not to teach these skills to other Tahitians.</p>\n<p>In July 1805, Pomare began writing directly to the Directors of the Missionary Society in London, receiving a response in late 1806. In his subsequent reply, dated 1 January 1807, Pomare II sought to deepen his relationship with the directors, praising Jehovah and agreeing to ‘banish Oro, and send him to Raiatea’, the island from which the cult of the war god had come, and which remained its spiritual centre. In return, Pomare II asked for ‘property and cloth as well as muskets, powder, paper, ink and pens, as well as ‘all the curious things that you have in England’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c4-8\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c4-8\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Map of the Society Islands in French Polynesia, showing major islands like Tahiti, Bora Bora, and Moorea, with geographical details.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/4/c4-8.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Map of French PolynesiaShowing locations of Tahiti, Moorea, Huahine &amp; Raiatea.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Thanks to dc3airways.net</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Map of the Society Islands in French Polynesia, showing major islands like Tahiti, Bora Bora, and Moorea, with geographical details.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/4/c4-8.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Map of French PolynesiaShowing locations of Tahiti, Moorea, Huahine &amp; Raiatea.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Thanks to dc3airways.net</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Towards the end of 1808, discontent with Pomare II and his close alliance with the missionaries initiated a rebellion, as a result of which all but four of the unmarried missionaries left Tahiti for the island of Huahine. The culmination of the conflict was a major battle on 22 December 1808 that saw Pomare II and his allies defeated, despite a prophet of Oro promising them victory.</p>\n<p>The rebels ravaged Matavai, from where Pomare II and the remaining missionaries fled to the neighbouring island of Moorea. From there, all the missionaries except Henry Nott went to Huahine, and in October 1809 all but one left for Australia.</p>\n<p>Disillusioned with Oro, Pomare II spent a great deal of time reading and thinking, developing a deeper interest in the God of the missionaries through the counsel of Henry Nott. He told Nott in July 1812 that he wanted to be baptised and when questioned on the sincerity of his commitment, Pomare II stated that ‘You do not know the thoughts of my heart, nor I yours, but God does’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>In August 1813 Pomare returned to Tahiti to reassert his authority – the missionaries worried that he would be exposed to alcohol and its attendant temptations. Nevertheless, his renunciation of ‘the idol gods and the religion of his country’ impressed the missionaries.</p>\n<p>Visiting Tahiti, they discovered a prayer-meeting had been instituted with the names of the <em>Pure Atua</em> – praying people – recorded in a book. By the end of 1814 this included 204 names. In January 1815 the missionaries wrote to London, concerned that Pomare wanted to be the first Christian to be baptised among his people, while remaining, according to them, ‘a slave to drinking’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c4-9\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c4-9\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A historical engraving depicting the destruction of idols and a pagan altar, while a Christian church is being constructed in the background.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/4/c4-9.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Cover of Missionary Sketches 6.

He took the <em>to’o,</em> or God images, from the <em>marae</em> and created a pyre on the beach. Reciting their names and pedigrees, he stripped them f their coconut fibre wrapping and feathers one by one before casting them into the fire.</p>\n<p>This action initiated an outburst of iconoclasm that spread rapidly across both Moorea and Tahiti, with Pomare encouraging people to join this festival of flames.</p>\n<p>An attempt to kill the <em>Pure Atua</em> (praying people) of Tahiti saw them flee once more to Moorea, but they subsequently returned to Tahiti with Pomare II at their head. A battle on 12 November 1815, when the Christians were attacked at church, proved decisive.</p>\n<p>Whether the events in Tahiti during 1815 were related to the eruption of Mount Tambora, a volcano on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa, on 10 April is unclear from missionary accounts. However, this was one of the largest volcanic events ever recorded and atmospheric ash generated brilliantly coloured sunsets all over the world for months. How these portents were regarded in Tahiti can only be imagined.</p>\n<p>Pomare’s restraint in exerting retribution following his victory, including offering respectful burial to enemies killed in battle, seems to have persuaded his erstwhile enemies to accept his overlordship as a Christian king. Following the victory, Pomare set about destroying ‘gods’ and maraes, but also building churches as new places of worship.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c4-10\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c4-10\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A collection of historical idols from the Pomare family, featuring wooden figures and ceremonial objects displayed on a printed background.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/4/c4-10.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Digital Reconstruction of 'the Family Idols of Pomare’using objects now in the British Museum that are likely to have come from the London Missionary Society</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A collection of historical idols from the Pomare family, featuring wooden figures and ceremonial objects displayed on a printed background.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/4/c4-10.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Digital Reconstruction of 'the Family Idols of Pomare’using objects now in the British Museum that are likely to have come from the London Missionary Society</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"fig-c4-11\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c4-11\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Close-up of a long, cylindrical woven object made from natural fibers, showcasing intricate patterns and textures.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/4/c4-11.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">3.

It is tempting to read his reference to ‘curiosity’ as an echo of the <em>Chronicle’s</em> language.</p>\n<p>William Ellis, after he had arrived at Tahiti, recorded in his diary for 26 April 1817 that Pomare had been ‘much pleased with the portraits in the Evangelical Magazine, and some prints of Natural History’, so it is not impossible that Pomare would have seen the Missionary Chronicle.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup></p>\n<p>However, a journal of the Tahiti mission records that magazines arrived from England on 29 December 1815, but none dated later than the beginning of January 1814, which makes it unlikely Pomare would have seen the appeal for the new Missionary Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup></p>\n<p>Earlier in the year, however, on 6 May 1815, the Queen Charlotte had arrived at Moorea with letters dated between December 1813 and July 1814. In the Missionary Chronicle of May 1814 a notice had appeared noting the arrival of ‘specimens of idols… especially from China’, which expressed an intention on the part of the Society to exhibit them to their friends:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;not merely to gratify curiosity, but to excite their pity, their prayers, and their exertions in behalf of millions of their fellow-creatures, sitting in the region of the shadow of death.</em> <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n<p>While it is possible Pomare may have seen this, it probably makes most sense to understand Pomare’s despatch of the idols as part of his ongoing attempt to convince the missionaries of the sincerity of his conversion.</p>\n<p>In addition, he clearly wanted to develop a relationship of exchange directly with the centre of missionary power in London, rather than with missionary proxies in Tahiti – his Hawaiian advisor with experience of London presumably gave Pomare an important insight into the real locus of British power.</p>\n<p>Pomare’s strategy was successful, resulting in a correspondence with Rev. Dr. Haweis, initiator of the mission to Tahiti. Writing in October 1818, just after his family idols finally reached London, Pomare thanked Haweis for his letter of August 1817 and the gift of books, as well as an earlier gift of a pocket watch.</p>\n<p>Pomare explained that a local Missionary Society had been established in Tahiti to collect coconut oil, pork, arrow-root and cotton as missionary tribute, informing Haweis that he had decided to name a ship he had built at Tahiti after him. He also stated:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;I have sent you the evil spirits (idols) which you sent to me for. All the large idols are consumed, having been burned in the fire. This is only a little one that remains. The name of the little idol is Taroa.</em><br>\n<br/><em>I also send you two little fans which the Royal Family of these countries were accustomed to fan themselves with. When the day of the festival arrived, and the King was prayed for, those were the fans they used to fan away the flies. This was an established custom among the princes in former times. The name of those fans is Nunaachau. They fastened them to the handle, and this used them to drive away the flies. What am I to do with the little pearl box, which was enclosed in the parcel which you sent me? Had it been directed to me, it would have been right; but there is another name on it, that of the Queen of Lattakkoo; that is the reason I inform you of it. I have sent back the little pearl box to Mr Marsden at Port Jackson, that he may return it to you. If you write to me again I shall be glad. If it be agreeable, send me three books: one very large bible: one good portable one, very small; and one book of geography.</em><br>\n<br/><em>If it be not agreeable, very well, do not think evil of me, dear friend, for the small request that I make in the conclusion of my letter. We are well; and I shall be glad to hear that you are well also.</em><br>\n<br/><em>May you be blessed by Jesus Christ, the true King of Salvation, by whom we must all be saved.</em></p>\n<p><em>POMARE<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup></em></p>\n<p>If Pomare’s ‘Family Idols’ were his response to a divine Gift of Grace, he clearly didn’t anticipate the exchange ending there, and his early requests for guns and powder were now converted into requests for books and knowledge – sending Pomare the books he requested was one of Haweis’ very last acts on earth.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is easy to see how the evangelical theology of Grace, freely given by God though the sacrifice of Christ could be understand in relation to a Polynesian theology of <em>mana</em> – divine and ancestral power – concentrated in <em>to’o</em> and acquired through sacrifice and participation in ceremonies. What need had Pomare for older <em>to’o</em> if he could access <em>mana</em> through the word of God, concentrated in the textual form of the bible and other books?</p>\n<p>As a wave of conversion enveloped Tahiti and the surrounding islands, the need for missionaries and bibles became increasingly urgent. On 13 February 1817, William Ellis finally arrived at Moorea, bringing with him a technology that would prove central to the spread of Christianity across the Pacific – a printing press. On 30 June 1817, Ellis looked on as Pomare printed the very first page of a Tahitian spelling book.</p>\n<p>On 25 August 1819 the Rev. Rowland Hill, a founder and Director of the London Missionary Society addressed a Missionary Festival in Cornwall, gathered at the Independent Chapel in Falmouth. According to a report in the Missionary Chronicle:</p>\n<p><em>&gt;Before the meeting closed the principal idol of Pomare’s family was conveyed round the Chapel by Mr Hill’s servant: its workmanship was admired for the ingenuity it displayed, and while the idol itself excited commiseration for those who still worship such ‘foolish Gods’, thansgivings were offered to Jehovah, that Taheite’s idols are no more!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup></em></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c4-16\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c4-16\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An excerpt of a poem reflecting on the relinquished idols of Otaheite in a Missionary Museum, exploring themes of faith and enlightenment.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/4/c4-16.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Poetry.

According to a catalogue of the Missionary Museum, printed in London in 1826, this was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An instrument of incantation used by the Pehemen, either to drive away sickness or to inflict it. The natives tremble at the rattle as though the earth was opening to swallow them up, and would not dare to shake it except on special occasions.

British control was consolidated during the Napoleonic wars, so the British parliament’s 1807 Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade prohibited the further importation of enslaved people from Africa.</p>\n<p>The rising political power of evangelicals in Britain threatened the established economic model of plantation slavery, but also led to an increasing presence of evangelicals on the ground in the Caribbean. John Wray used to tell his children that as he sailed into Demerara in February 1808, the last vessel to import a cargo of enslaved people sailed out.<br>\nThis passing of ships, whether in the night or not, retains its potential to symbolise an important shift in the tides of Atlantic history. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Directors of the Missionary Society despatched Wray, aged 27, to Demerara at the end of 1807 in response to a request from Hermanus Hilbertus Post, the Dutch-born owner of Le Resouvenir. Post had begun his career in the Caribbean in 1774 as an overseer, but soon acquired land on which he established his plantation.<br>\nWracked by a sense of his own sinfulness and in pursuit of redemption, Post built a chapel at Le Resouvenir capable of accommodating 600 people. This was given the name Bethel, a house of God in the ‘barren wilderness’ of slave-owning Demerara. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup><br>\nWray’s arrival generated anxiety among the colony’s planters, who feared he would turn Demerara into a second St Domingue – Haiti having established its independence from France in 1804, a mere four years earlier, following its 1791 revolution.<br>\nThe planters accused Post of introducing ‘anarchy, disorder and discontent among the enslaved’.  <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup><br>\nIn 1808, The Demerara and Essequebo Royal Gazette suggested:<br>\nIt is dangerous to make slaves Christians, without giving them their liberty… What will be the consequence when to that class of men is given the title of beloved brethren, as is actually done? Will not the negro conceive that by baptism, being made a Christian, he is as credible as his Christian white brethren? <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>In a colony of approximately 2,500 White people, 2,500 free Black people and 70,000 enslaved Black people, around half African-born, the logic of race asserted itself in the face of claims to Christian brotherhood. Just as in South Africa, efforts were made by those with power to prevent missionaries teaching the enslaved to read and write, lest they be exposed to dangerous political texts from abroad.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c5-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c5-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Illustration of a chapel and mission house surrounded by palm trees in Demerara, showcasing a lush, tropical landscape.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/5/c5-4.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Bethel Chapel and Mission House at Le Resouvenir.

Sundays were used to cultivate gardens for food as well as to sell produce at market, so religious meetings were arranged in the evening, when they had to compete with the ‘drumming, dancing, intoxication and other evils’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup><br>\nExposure to Christian teaching was intended to reform these activities – drumming and dancing in particular appearing to suggest the ongoing influence of African religious practices. As early as November 1808, Wray was reporting that after a funeral, some of his congregation had assembled to sing hymns and pray rather than ‘meeting together to drum and dance, as formerly’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> A letter to London from Hermanus Post in January 1809 suggested that enslaved people on a neighbouring estate were:<br>\nformerly a nuisance to the neighbourhood, on account of their drumming, dancing, &amp;c. Two or three nights in the week, and were looked on with a jealous eye, on account of their dangerous communications; but they are now become the most zealous attenders on public worship… No drums are used in this neighbourhood, except where the owners have prohibited the attendance of their slaves. Drunkards and fighters are changed into sober and peaceable people, and endeavour to please those who are set over them. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup><br>\nWray reported that even the plantation manager was astonished by the change in his charges, who ‘Before they heard the Gospel, they were indolent, noisy and rebellious; but now they are industrious, quiet and obedient,’ but also that now people would work without the application of the whip. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>This was the argument abolitionists most wanted to make – that improving conditions for enslaved people would result in less brutality by overseers and more harmonious relations. At least from the perspective of Post and Wray, religious conversion formed a central plank in this project.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c5-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c5-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An engraving of Plantation Le Resouvenir, featuring Mr. Post's house, Coffee Lodge, and Mr. Smith's Chapel amid palm trees and water.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/5/c5-5.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Plantation Le RessouvenirPublished in Missionary Sketches XXVI in July 1824.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Archive.org</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"An engraving of Plantation Le Resouvenir, featuring Mr. Post's house, Coffee Lodge, and Mr. Smith's Chapel amid palm trees and water.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/5/c5-5.png\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Plantation Le RessouvenirPublished in Missionary Sketches XXVI in July 1824.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Archive.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>While the unenlightened attitudes of slave-owners was something to be overcome, non-Christian religious practices with roots in Africa among the enslaved posed an equal threat to this new dispensation.<br>\nIn May 1811, Governor Bentinck of Demerara followed Jamaica in banning assemblies of slaves between sunset and sunrise, effectively prohibiting Wray’s church meetings. When his appeals to the Governor were ignored, Wray left on a cotton ship for Liverpool. Through evangelical circles in London, he took his complaints to the heart of government.</p>\n<p>Returning at the end of the year, Wray had secured an official instruction to allow religious meetings on Sundays between five in the morning and nine at night, and between seven and nine in the evening on other days. When Governor Bentinck attempted to delay the implementation of this policy, he was recalled.</p>\n<p>Wray, however, had drawn attention to himself in London, where a major experiment was in the offing.

The distinction between malevolent action against others and healing or preventive practice seems to have been important to enslaved people, but was essentially ignored by Europeans. While Wray dismissed much of what he was told, he concluded that ‘It is impossible to describe the influence these men obtain over the minds of the negroes’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>Diana Paton has suggested that the term ‘Obeah’, first defined as a crime in Jamaica following Tacky’s rebellion in 1760, spread around the English-speaking Caribbean at this period – ‘obeah’ laws were passed in Berbice in 1801 and 1810. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tacky’s rebels had conducted oaths and rituals based on Akan practices from the Gold Coast, now Ghana, so the Act to Remedy Evils arising form the Irregular Assemblies of Slaves included a clause outlawing ‘the wicked Art of Negroes going under the appellation of Obeah Men and Women, pretending to have Communication with the Devil and other evil spirits’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup></p>\n<p>If Obeah as a crime was originally associated with rebellion and unrest, by implication the introduction of Christianity should have been associated with peaceable relations between the enslaved and their masters.<br>\nThis association was quickly challenged.</p>\n<p>In 1814 rumours circulated across Berbice of an insurrection on the west coast, for which Wray was initially blamed by planters. It turned out, however, that none of those involved were ‘Crown slaves’, and an enquiry suggested that rather than rebelling they had been attempting to establish a society on the model of the Freemasons.</p>\n<p>Alternative forms of authority were nevertheless viewed with suspicion, and six of those identified as ringleaders were executed, decapitated and their heads put on stakes at their home plantations. In addition, dancing was outlawed across the colony for the rest of the year, with travel between estates made conditional on the presentation of travel passes. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup></p>\n<p>Following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 and the establishment of peace in Europe, the Crown estates and the majority of ‘Crown slaves’ were returned to the Society of Berbice in July 1816.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c5-9\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c5-9\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A woman kneels in distress as a man holds a whip, while another man instructs him in a lush, oppressive environment.

He continued to visit congregations at the former Crown estates, just as he made regular visits back to Le Resouvenir. It was presumably on one of these visits that Wray came to hear of the mistreatment of America, a woman from the Sandvoort estate. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>Hearing that her daughter had been flogged, she confronted the mistress of the White estate manager who had taken her daughter as a servant. For this ‘impertinence’, America, in the late stages of pregnancy was stripped naked, tied to the ground and given 170 lashes with a cart whip while the estate manager watched, smoking his pipe.</p>\n<p>Although she survived, she lost her child, but the case deeply distressed Wray and his wife – their daughter reported that ‘the lashes inflicted on these poor creatures seemed to eat into his very soul’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup> This distress was undoubtedly exacerbated by the fact that Wray’s wife had until recently been providing midwifery services to pregnant women on the estate.<br>\nIn search of justice, Wray once again sailed to Liverpool, arriving in early 1818. While in England, he addressed a number of Church meetings, pleading against the flogging of women, but also presumably about the evils of Obeah. It was during this visit that he presented the rattle to the Missionary Museum.</p>\n<p>In January 1819, after Wray had returned to Berbice, the Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle published a short report on the adoption of legal measures against Obeah in Martinique, noting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the Missionary Museum is one of the rattles, formed of a hollowed fruit, with a long handle, employed by the Obeah men in their malicious and cruel practices. We wish well to the plans of the magistracy, but are persuaded that the influence of the Gospel will prove the most effectual means of suppressing this evil. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the description in the 1823 museum catalogue suggested the rattle was used ‘to drive away sickness or to inflict it’, the Evangelical magazine didn’t hesitate to emphasise that it was used in ‘malicious and cruel practices’. The description of its form, however, having been made from a hollowed fruit, or more likely gourd, provides an important clue to its origin and function.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c5-10\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c5-10\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A lush landscape featuring a dirt path lined with palm trees, a thatched house, people engaged in daily activities, and distant factories.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/5/c5-10.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Plantation drive, Demerara.

Here, he met an old man who told them he was a Christian, having been baptised many years previously by Moravians on the Courantyne River, the boundary of Berbice with the Dutch colony of Suriname.<br>\nIn December of the same year, Wray travelled forty miles up the Courantyne river to Equevi creek, where he visited two Warrao villages with William Ross, ‘Protector of the Berbice Indians‘.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup></p>\n<p>It seems very likely that the rattle was collected on one of these visits – from an indigenous shaman rather than an enslaved ‘Obeah man’.</p>\n<p>It is perhaps significant that apart from a ‘Boa Constrictor in the act of devouring an antelope’, presumably a product of taxidermy, the only other items associated with Wray in the 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum were an unspecified number of:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WAR CLUBS curiously carved by South American Indians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A later version of the catalogue describes three ‘quadrangular’ clubs of hard wood, ‘used by Macusi and Caribbee Indians of Guiana’.<br>\nThe catalogue description of the rattle, given above, refers to ‘the natives’ rather than enslaved people, many of whom in 1826 would not have been native, in that they would have been born in Africa.</p>\n<p>It seems very likely, therefore, that Wray’s description of the rattle as used by ‘the natives’ for healing was amended by someone in London who had never been to the Caribbean to add ‘an Instrument of Obeah, or Incantation, very dreadful to the Negroes’.<br>\nAlternatively, it could indicate the regard that enslaved people had for the ceremonial practices of the indigenous people of the land.</p>\n<p>The British Museum has a rattle, acquired from the London Missionary Society, that is recorded as coming from the Berbice River in Guyana by its online catalogue. It is described as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pelu, rattle made of gourd, cotton, feathers<br>\nThe photograph online appears to match the sketch on a loan slip, produced in 189 when the British Museum borrowed a selection of rare items to display from the missionary museum (LMS 6). <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Below a curator’s description, further text is recorded in quotation marks, presumably fom a label or written directly on the rattle itself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>515<br>\nWest Indies No. 10<br>\nA pehi Berbice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The number 515 relates to a catalogue produced for a large missionary exhibition in Paris in 1867, the catalogue of which describes 515 as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Un Péhi secoué sur les malades pour leur guérison.<br>\nPEHI, an instrument of Obiah, or incantations, used by the Pehemen, either to drive away sickness, or to inflict it.

This may suggest that from a missionary perspective there was a degree of equivalence between the healing practices of the enslaved people of African descent, and the indigenous people of Guyana.<br>\nIn 1913, the colonial administrator and keen amateur anthropologist Walter E Roth, then commissioner of the Pomeroon District in British Guiana, published An Enquiry into the Animism and Folk-lore of the Guiana Indians. On page 330 he included a line drawing of a rattle, very similar in form to that in the British Museum, which he captioned Piai’s rattle.</p>\n<p>According to Roth, hollowed gourds were filled with seeds and stones with unusual origins which gave the rattle its power – these included seeds extracted from the piai teacher’s stomach and stones that were a gift of the Water Spirits.</p>\n<p>Roth was told by an Arawak ‘medicine-man’ that the feathers must come from a special kind of parrot (Psittacus aestivus) and must be plucked from the bird while it is still alive. The plumage of this species certainly seems to match the feathers on the rattle in the British Museum, even though it is now over 200 years old. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup></p>\n<p>According to Roth, the rattle itself is called, not a Pehi, but a maráka, an Arawak word that has become common in European languages, but was according to Arawak tradition a gift from the Spirits.</p>\n<p>According to Roth, it was ‘held in great veneration event by Christian converts who have ceased to use it’ while people may ‘fear to touch it or even approach a place where it is kept’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the context of missionary activity and conversion, what could be a more powerful tangible demonstration of conversion than to hand one of these potent rattles to a missionary? In addition to being a gift that demonstrated an intention to renounce spiritual practices, giving a rattle to someone like Wray removed it from a location where it posed a risk and could continue to cause harm.<br>\nIn the 1960s, the anthropologist Peter Riviere similarly agreed to take a converted Trio’s shaman’s rattle away with him, ultimately donating it the Pitt Rivers Museum. It seems that for a shaman, sending away a rattle that linked you with your spirit familiars, with which you had a close and intimate relationship, was easier than destroying it  – one Trio shaman stated ‘they are like children to me…Who in the world destroys something that is like a child to him’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup></p>\n<p>When I contacted Peter Riviere to ask whether he could help me to make sense of the rattle and Wray’s description, he told me that he thought Pehi was a transliteration of piai, a word widely used to mean shaman or healer. The Oxford English Dictionary records the word being used in English from 1613 onwards to refer to people who were glossed as priests, doctors, diviners, charmers, sorcerers or soothsayers. This suggests that no satisfactory English equivalent was available. Riviere thought that Peheman was almost certainly a transliteration of piaiman or piaime, meaning the practice of ‘being shamanic’ – a quality that in indigenous thought everyone has, but only some develop to a high degree of mastery. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup></p>\n<p>The rattle then, was not unlike the ‘Idol Gods’ sent from Tahiti by Pomare as a token of conversion, and actually seems to have arrived at the Missionary Museum in London before the long-delayed parcel from the Pacific. It has not retained the same notoriety, illustrated by the fact that its association with Wray and the early mission to Guyana was forgotten at the British Museum.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c5-15\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c5-15\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An engraved portrait of Rev.

He was pleased with what seemed its functioning Christian congregation and the 2000 people under instruction for Catechism, although he lamented that the missionaries were still not allowed to teach their charges to read.</p>\n<p>In January 1823 the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Domininions was founded in London, as leadership of the anti-slavery movement was passed from William Wilberforce, who had effected parliamentary abolition of the trade in 1807, to Thomas Fowell Buxton. Their first achievement was the passing of a parliamentary resolution recommending further reforms.</p>\n<p>As a result, regulations were sent to Crown colonies limiting labour for the enslaved to nine hours a day, and abolishing the flogging of women. While the Governor of Berbice asked Wray to announce these policies from his pulpit, in Demerara Governor Murray attempted to delay the implementation of these measures. Rumours spread, and some believed he was suppressing a full grant of freedom.</p>\n<p>After six weeks with no announcement, a meeting was held on one of the estates that neighboured Le Resouvenir after the church services on Sunday 17 August 1823. The following day some of the enslaved congregation came out on strike.<br>\nWhen the Governor rode out to meet a group of forty men who had gathered, finally telling them the details of the new regulations, they refused to lay down their weapons and shots were fired.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c5-16\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c5-16\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A historical illustration depicting Lieutenant Brady's retreat, with soldiers and locals amidst a tropical landscape.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/5/c5-16.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Retreat of Lieutenant Brady Plate in Joshua Bryant’s 1824 Account of an insurrection of the negro slaves in the colony of Demerara, which broke out on the 18th of August, 1823.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">John Carter Brown Library. 05684-5</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"A historical illustration depicting Lieutenant Brady's retreat, with soldiers and locals amidst a tropical landscape.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/5/c5-16.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Retreat of Lieutenant Brady Plate in Joshua Bryant’s 1824 Account of an insurrection of the negro slaves in the colony of Demerara, which broke out on the 18th of August, 1823.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">John Carter Brown Library. 05684-5</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>The subsequent uprising seems to have been initiated by Jack Gladstone, son of Quamina (or Kwamina/Kwami) a carpenter and stalwart member and deacon of John Smith’s congregation at Le Resouvenir. Jack took his surname from the owner of his estate, Sir John Gladstone, whose own son William would the become Prime Minister of Britain 45 years later.<br>\nWhile Quamina seems to have attempted to prevent an outbreak of extreme violence, locking estate overseers and managers in the stocks rather than killing them, the Governor and planter society marshalled troops to send out against the rising.<br>\nTwo hundred people were killed in the action and martial law was imposed, with a further 50 people put to death and many others whipped.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c5-17\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c5-17\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Quatered image showing people hanging from gallows.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/5/c5-17.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Five of the culprits in chains, as they appeared on 20 September 1823.

John Smith was arrested and held for seven weeks, before being tried by Court Martial on 13 October 1823 for four charges that included:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Promoting ’discontent and dissatisfaction in the minds of the Negro Slaves towards their Lawful Masters, Managers and Overseers’ and exciting Revolt</li>\n<li>Advising, consulting and corresponding with Quamina both before and during the revolt</li>\n<li>Not making the intended rebellion known to the proper Authorities</li>\n<li>Not using his best endeavours to suppress, detain and restrain Quamina once the rebellion was under way.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup><br>\nFound guilty of all four charges, Smith was sentenced to death by hanging, but the court recommended mercy ‘under the circumstances of the case’.

Authorities arranged for his burial to be carried out secretly in the middle of the night and demolished the grave his supporters built.</p>\n<p>As a result of Smith’s death, the London Missionary Society gained its first martyr – in the years that followed he became widely known as the “Demerara Martyr”. Outrage in Britain at Smith’s death  – together with the widespread loss of life among the enslaved – played a significant role in mobilising public support for the campaign to abolish slavery, culminating in the 1833 Act for the abolition of slavery throughout the British Colonies.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the President of Guyana, David Granger declared that 20 August would henceforth be known as ‘Demerara Martyrs’ Day’, extending the category of martyrdom to all those who participated and were killed in the uprising. He committed to building a new memorial at Independence Park in the capital, the former parade ground where the executions of those condemned to death by Court Martial were carried out.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Smith, Thomas. 1825.

Sent by the Rev. Henry Townley as a gift from the Bengal Auxiliary Missionary Society, they were described as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Twenty-two models of Hindoo deities, [carved in wood, about a foot in height, and painted] such as are ordinarily manufactured in that idolatrous country. Prints taken from these are intended to be given in the Missionary Sketches, accompanied by explanations from the Rev. Mr. Ward’s History of the Literature and the Religion of the Hindoos.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A month after their arrival, the cover of Missionary Sketches featured nine of Townley’s models, each with the name of the God they depicted printed beneath.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup><br>\nAbbreviated descriptions of each God, summarising Ward’s text, were given on the following pages. In a footer at the end of the descriptions, a paragraph clarified their intended message, positioning the work of missionaries in India as a direct continuation of a long-term battle against religious idols, documented in both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are specimens, Christian Reader, of the gods of the heathen in India, worshipped by more than a hundred millions of deluded people. These are the creatures of a corrupt imagination, and the workmanship of men’s hands ­­­— “they have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; they have ears, but they hear not; they have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither speak they through their throat. They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusted in them. O Israel, trust thou in the Lord.” Psalm cxv. 5—10.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These conjunctions of artefact, image and text illustrate the strong connections between items sent to the Missionary Museum and the images and texts that appeared in missionary publications. It seems likely that Townley, like John Smith in Demerara, had seen the early issues of Missionary Sketches from 1818, featuring the Trimurti from Elephanta, Mantis the Soothsayer from South Africa, and the Family Idols of Pomare from Tahiti. A fairly recent arrival in India, Townley had been sent to Calcutta by the Missionary Society’s Directors in 1816.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c6-2\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c6-2\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A missionary baptizes an individual in the Ganges River, surrounded by a landscape featuring palm trees and distant buildings.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/6/c6-2.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">William Ward baptising a Hindoo in the Ganges at Serampore1821 stipple engraving on paper by Henry Meyer, based on painting by John Jackson.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Scottish National Portrait Gallery (CC BY NC).

Mr. Ward, on the other hand, was William Ward, something of a veteran with nearly two decades of experience working for Baptist Missionary Society in India. In the aftermath of the French revolution, non-conformist churches in Britain had been associated with political radicalism, and the official line of the East India Company prohibited their missionaries from operating in areas it controlled. Sympathetic Company officials, however, had turned a blind eye to the activities of William Carey, the original Baptist missionary, after he arrived in India in 1793, particularly when he was officially employed on an indigo plantation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>The arrival of William Ward, along with three other Baptist missionaries and their families, in 1799, was harder to ignore. The recently arrived Anglo-Irish Governor-General, Richard Wellesley, pursuing a war against the French and their allies in Mysore, refused them permission to join Carey in Bengal. As a consequence, the Baptists established themselves at Serampore, a Danish controlled town less than twenty miles north of Calcutta, the capital of British India, much to Wellesley’s initial displeasure.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Originally a printer and journalist from Derby in the British Midlands, Ward was responsible for the printing press at Serampore, established in 1800, where translations of the Bible were printed in Bengali, Marathi, Hindi and other Indian languages.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> The project of religious translation involved working closely with Indian scholars such as Ram Ram Basu, who was worked for Carey as his munshi (language teacher).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Governor Wellesley established Fort William College in Calcutta in 1801, it was Carey he appointed to teach Bengali, assisted by Basu. The project of translation operated in multiple directions—Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana were published in Bengali in 1802-03. From 1805 the Baptists were even paid a stipend by the Asiatic Society at Fort William College to translate and publish Sanskrit texts in English<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup></p>\n<p>The first volume of Ward’s Account of the Writings, Religion, and Manners of the Hindoos including Translations from their Principal Works was printed at the Mission Press in Serampore in 1806, with the fourth volume completed in 1811, just before a fire destroyed the print works (Ward 1811). A second edition, “carefully abridged and greatly improved”, was printed between 1815 and 1818 under the title A View of the History, Literature, and Religion of the Hindoos, with a third edition printed in Britain by the Baptist Missionary Society between 1817 and 1820.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c6-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c6-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An illustration of the Indian deity Ganesa, depicted with an elephant head, four arms, and various symbolic objects, surrounded by text.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/6/c6-3.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Representation of the Indian Idol, Ganesa.

The Evangelical Magazine, however, was not content to adopt a position of straightforward condescension in relation to this ‘idolatry’, noting that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The superstitious regard paid by these blind idolaters to a senseless image, may put to shame many who are better informed, and who call themselves Christians, but who live practically “without God in the world;” who never acknowledge the Creator and Preserver; and who daily go out and return home, amidst a thousand dangers, without seeking his guidance or protection.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure id=\"fig-c6-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c6-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Illustration of a native school in Chinsurah, East Indies, featuring an exterior view and interior classroom setup with students and furniture.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/6/c6-4.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Representations of One of the Native Schools at Chinsurah In the East Indies.

Arriving five years after William Carey, also without an official licence, Nathaniel Forsyth preached in and around Calcutta with the tacit support of Company officials. With minimal financial assistance from the Society in London, he found Calcutta expensive and lived for a time on a boat, until appointed minister of the Dutch church at Chinsurah (Hugli-Chuchura) in West Bengal. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup></p>\n<p>Only in 1804 were further missionaries sent to India by the LMS, but they went to the south. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, the major Indian campaigns undertaken by the Society seem to have been largely conducted through a war of words in London.<br>\nIn July 1806 an uprising at Vellore Fort in Tamil Nadu, South India, following the implementation of new uniform regulations involving the trimming of beards and removal of caste marks, was connected to the circulation of rumours about forced conversion to Christianity. Evangelicals sought to blame the family of Tipu Sultan, imprisoned at the fort, as well as the Madras administration, invoking the weight of British evangelical opinion in an attempt to avert a wholesale recall of missionaries from India. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Making the case for the opposition was the Rev. Sydney Smith, who, in his essay “Indian Missions” published in The Edinburgh Review of February 1808, quoted the Transactions of the Missionary Society at length to illustrate the strong reactions missionary activity provoked in India. Smith argued that it was perilous to proselytise in a precarious India ‘without incurring the utmost risk of losing our empire’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> In the essay, which Smith himself later characterised as ‘routing out a nest of consecrated cobblers’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup>, he famously asked: ‘Why are we to send out little detachments of maniacs to spread over the fine regions of the world the most unjust and contemptible opinion of the gospel?’ <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>Evangelicals were ultimately successful in defending the admittedly fairly ambiguous status quo, but many of the same arguments resurfaced in the years leading up to the British government’s renewal of the East India Company’s charter in 1813.<br>\nEvangelical networks across the British Isles were mobilised in a campaign that led to 908 petitions supporting the promulgation of Christianity in India being submitted to the British parliament, at that time the largest number ever presented. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup>  In a parliamentary compromise orchestrated by William Wilberforce, all sides were enabled to believe they had achieved some of their aims. A new clause in the charter of the East India Company made it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the Duty of this country, to promote the interests and happiness of the native inhabitants of the British dominions in India, and that such measures ought to be adopted as may tend to the introduction among them of useful knowledge, and of religious and moral improvement. That in the furtherance of the above objects, sufficient facilities shall be afforded by law, to persons desirous of going to, and remaining in India, for the purpose of accomplishing those benevolent designs. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure id=\"fig-c6-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c6-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Illustration of various Hindu idols labeled with names like Vishnu, Ganesha, and Shiva, showcasing traditional artistry and cultural significance.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/6/c6-5.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">HINDOO IDOLS, Copied from Models, sent by the Rev.

Robert May of the London Missionary Society established thirty schools, educating nearly 3000 children including 700 sons of Brahmins in and around Chinsurah between 1812 and 1816. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup>   The exterior, interior and plan view of one of these schools was depicted on the cover of Missionary Sketches in October 1820, a year after the cover had featured Townley’s ‘Hindoo Idols’. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was in the wake of this campaign and the resulting new clause that Henry Townley had been sent to re-establish the Society’s mission at Calcutta, following the death of Forsyth. The Bengal Auxiliary Missionary Society was established in December 1817 to raise funds locally to support missionary activity. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup> Prompted to contribute to the stock of missionary images, Townley, acting on behalf of the Auxiliary Society either purchased or commissioned a set of twenty-two murti (models)—images of Hindu gods.</p>\n<p>It is significant these were described as “models”. This may have been an attempt to translate the word murti, which carries a sense that such figures take the material form of a god, without being gods in themselves, but it more likely suggests that they were acquired from the craftspeople who made them, rather than from temples or homes, where they had already been the focus for puja or bhakti (religious devotion). Unlike Pomare’s Family Idols, these were not given up by converts to Christianity, but they remained useful in illustrating the religious practices of India for missionary supporters across the world.</p>\n<p>The fact that eight of the murti were arranged on the cover of Missionary Sketches around the black-faced figure of Jugunnathu is significant, reflecting this figure’s centrality to early nineteenth century British imaginations of Indian religion. A note in parentheses in the accompanying written account points out that the name of this God is ‘usually written Juggernaut’, explaining that this name is a title for a deified hero meaning “Lord of the World”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup></p>\n<p>The form of the image, with no legs and only stumps for arms but a very large head and eyes was explained: having been commissioned to house the bones of Krishna, its maker was interrupted at work, leaving the image unfinished. Brahma, himself, however, was said to have given the murti its eyes and a soul.</p>\n<p>The focus of the printed description in Missionary Sketches then shifts from the image itself to the temple to Jagganath in Orissa and its annual Car Festival. As part of this, the crowd drew a tapering tower containing the image of Jagganath, between 50 to 60 feet high and with sixteen wheels. The description ends by noting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unnumbered multitudes of pilgrims, from all parts of India, attend this festival, among whom a great mortality frequently prevails; and hundreds, perhaps thousands of persons, diseased or distressed, have cast themselves under the wheels of this ponderous car, and have been crushed to death. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The subjugation of Orissa during the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803, pursued by Wellesley, placed the temple of Jagannath at Puri, a major site of regional pilgrimage, under the control of the East India Company. The appointment by the Company of a tax collector and committee to manage temple affairs upset evangelicals, who argued that this amounted to state-sponsored idolatry.</p>\n<p>The person most responsible for advancing this concern was Claudius Buchanan, an evangelical Scottish Anglican minister appointed to an East India Company chaplaincy in Bengal in 1796, who became vice-provost of Fort William College in 1800, where he worked closely with William Carey.<br>\nIn 1811 Buchanan published Christian Researches in Asia<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> and in December of that year, the Evangelical Magazine syndicated his description of the festival of Juggernaut in order to ‘kindle the zeal of European Christians in the support and extension of Missionary efforts’ by becoming ‘more intimately acquainted with the horrors of Heathenism’:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have returned home from witnessing a scene which I shall never forget. At twelve o’clock of this day, being the great day of the east, the Moloch of Hindoostan was brought out of his temple, amidst the acclamations of hundreds of thousands of his worshippers […]’<br>\nThe idol is a block of wood, having a frightful visage, painted black, with a distended mouth of a bloody colour […] An aged minister of the idol then stood up; and, with a long rod in his hand, which he moved with indecent action, completed the variety of this disgusting exhibition. I felt a consciousness of doing wrong in witnessing it […] The characteristics of Moloch’s worship are obscenity and blood. We have seen the former. Now comes the blood.<br>\nAfter the tower had proceeded some way, a pilgrim announced that he was ready to offer himself a sacrifice to the idol. He laid himself down in the road before the tower, as it was moving along, lying on his face, with arms stretched forwards. The multitude passed round him, leaving the space clear, and he was crushed to death by the wheels of the tower. A shout of joy was raised to the god. He is said to smile when the libation of the blood is made. The people threw cowries, or small money, on the body of the victim, in approbation of the deed. He was left to view a considerable time, and was then carried by the hurries to the Golgotha, where I have just been viewing his remains. How much I wished that the Proprietors of India Stock could have attended the wheels of Juggernaut, and seen this peculiar source of their revenue!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Buchanan’s reference to Moloch connected Jagannath to the Old Testament book of Leviticus but also to Milton’s Paradise Lost, making it clear he regarded the procession at Puri as a form of demonic idolatry, endorsed and managed by a British commercial company. The image of the immense and unstoppable car of Juggernaut, crushing pilgrims beneath its wheels was so potent that it captured early nineteenth century evangelical opinion, finding an enduring place in the English language.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the years that followed, the front cover of Missionary Sketches featured further Indian gods, with commentary supplied by Ward. In July 1820, an image of “Kalee, the black goddess of India” included a description of the animal sacrifices Ward witnessed at a festival in Calcutta:</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c6-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c6-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An illustration of Kalee, the Black Goddess of India, depicted with multiple arms, adorned with skulls and a fierce expression and holding a human head.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/6/c6-6.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Kalee, the Black Goddess of IndiaMissionary Sketches, No. X, July 1820.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Archive.org</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"An illustration of Kalee, the Black Goddess of India, depicted with multiple arms, adorned with skulls and a fierce expression and holding a human head.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/6/c6-6.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Kalee, the Black Goddess of IndiaMissionary Sketches, No. X, July 1820.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Archive.org</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Never did I see men so eagerly enter into the shedding of blood; the place literally swam with blood.

In addition to these nine, the following were included in the same list, albeit without the same degree of further description:</p>\n<p>CHOITUNYU, THE WISE\tSHIVU LINGU<br>\nUBHUYA\tRADHA<br>\nLU RUHMUNU\tVISWAKARMA<br>\nNUNDEE\tBULURAMU<br>\nKARTIKEYU\tBRUMHA<br>\nJUGUDDHATREE\tLUKSHMEE</p>\n<p>The original note in the Missionary Chronicle of September 1819 referred to ‘twenty-two models of Hindoo deities’. In the seven years between their arrival and the publication of the catalogue, one seems to have been lost or broken.</p>\n<p>Although they appear in nineteenth century images, such as that depicting the case ‘Indian Idols’ at the Missionary Museum, published in 1860, I haven’t been able to locate any of the original twenty-two models, two centuries after they arrived in London.</p>\n<p>The closest I have come is a somewhat damaged painted clay figure of Jagganath held by the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford (1910.62.84). Made from clay rather than wood, it has a different, less waisted, shape to the image located at the centre of the cover of Missionary Sketches in October 1819.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c6-13\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c6-13\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An intricate illustration featuring human figures, sculptures, and a seated figure on a lion, set against a backdrop of art.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/6/c6-13.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Case of Indian IdolsPublished in ‘The Missionary Museum No. V’. 1860.

Ultimately, the Prince Regent, as agift, would link the succeeding generation of island kings, George IV,previously the Prince Regent, and Kamehameha II, also known as Liholiho. Whenthe twenty-one year old assumed the throne, however, he had been greeted byQueen Ka’ahumanu, wearing his father’s royal robe. She declared she would rule alongsidehim as <em>Kuhina Nui</em> or Queen Regent.</p>\n<p>In November 1819, at a feast to commemorate Kamehameha I,Liholiho sat down and ate with the royal women, inaugurating the end of theexisting <em>kapu</em> (taboo) system – a period now referred to inHawai’ian as the ‘<em>Ai Noa</em> (free eating). It seems likely that thisaction was at least partly inspired by the actions of Pomare II in Tahitiduring 1815, since both Liholiho and Ka’ahumanu were aware of what had happenedthere.</p>\n<p>At the end of March 1822, however, it was not the Prince Regent that the Mermaid brought to Kealakekua Bay, having lost sight of hercharge on their way across the Pacific, but rather a party of twelvemissionaries.

It seems that for many Pacific islanders this was represented by the writtenword, but perhaps more precisely the printed word – Polynesian words convertedto marks that were impressed onto paper by the mission printing press.</p>\n<p>While the press was a mechanical device – like a sugarpress, or cotton mill – through which labour was transformed into new kinds ofartefacts, the attitude Polynesians took towards the paper on which the pressimprinted the word of god does not seem to have been immaterial to theimportance they afforded to books, and to the Bible as the word of god inparticular.</p>\n<p>For Europeans such as Tyerman and Bennet, it was natural tothink of the items they saw Polynesians wearing as made from native cloth, butthe <em>tapa</em> of the Tahitians and <em>kapa</em> of theHawai’ians was not cloth in a typical European sense. Rather than being wovenon a loom from fibre strands that form a warp and a weft, it is formed frombark fibres beaten to make them flat and flexible.</p>\n<p>In its material form, bark cloth with its interlockingstrands of horizontally oriented fibres, is rather more like paper than a woventextile. In Tahiti, high quality <em>tapa</em> was commonly bleachedwhite, with patterns printed onto it to enhance its appearance. In Hawai’i, theprocess of printing patterns onto bark cloth was called <em>palapala</em>, aword that would be extended, first to the printing of words onto paper, andlater to new forms of education in general.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>We might dismiss the concerns of European missionaries with‘scantily clad’ Hawaiians as a consequence of puritanical sexual morality, butwe shouldn’t dismiss the material connection between conversion, new ways ofcovering the body and the widespread circulation of printed texts. There is aPolynesian logic by which clothes elevate and enhance the bodies of theirwearers, making it unsurprising that at <em>Kealakekua Bay</em> it wasthe nobles or <em>ali’i</em> of Hawai’i who were wearing rather moreabout their bodies.</p>\n<p>This concern with wrapping and marking the body, alsoexpressed through tattooing, aligns in certain ways with missionarypreoccupations with dress as an indicator of modesty and respectability. Themarking of status and rank through forms of dress was common to both Atlanticand Pacific societies, and it seems that clothing, cloth but also paper formeda zone of recognition where common values could be negotiated and established.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c7-10\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c7-10\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Textile featuring intricate red patterns on a beige background, showcasing floral and zigzag designs.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/7/c7-10.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Decorated Tiputa, or barkcloth ponchoWith slit at centre for the head, from the Society Islands (Tahiti), unknown date.British Museum Oc.1982</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">© The Trustees of the British Museum.

ATahitian attendant of Queen Regent Ka’ahumanu arrived to ask that his fellowcountrymen be allowed to stay with the Kuhina Nui’s household. It turned outthat he was actually the brother of Auna’s wife, who had left Tahiti as a boy,thirty years previously. Auna and his wife were adopted into this extremelypowerful Hawai’ian household, instituting morning and evening prayers and teachingtheir companions about the new religion.</p>\n<p>Ellis found that his Tahitian enabled him to to make himselfunderstood, and when he preached in the language at the American chapel, thesermon was attended by an array of Hawai’ian nobles, Liholiho seated at theircentre. Tyerman and Bennet compared the event to the preaching of Paul to theAthenians, recorded in the Acts of the Apostles.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>They noted, however, that it was the appearance, dress andconversation of the Tahitian Christians that most impressed the assembled Hawai’ians. Ka’ahumanu evidently spent a great deal of time in conversationwith Auna’s wife about Tahitian politics and the changes brought by the newreligion, while the Tahitian women used their sewing skills to make new clothesfor the Queen Regent. Auna spent a good deal of his time instructing herhusband, Kaumuali’i, King of the island of Kaua’i (marked Tauai on the mapabove).</p>\n<p>From their base at Honolulu, Tyerman and Bennet observed theroyal trade in sandalwood, which saw this locally plentiful commodity traded toChina in American ships. Witnessing two thousand people carrying a vast load tothe coast, they suggested that the condition of the common people of Hawai’iwas akin to slavery – ‘they hold nothing which may not be taken from them bythe strong hand of arbitrary power’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Elsewhere they marvelled at the surf boards, <em>papahorua,</em> in people’s homes, ‘eight or ten feet long, wider at one endthan the other, and convex on both sides’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> They also met aSpaniard who had lived on the island for thirty years, as well as a BlackAmerican consulted for his healing skills by Hawaiians as well as visitingsailors.</p>\n<p>Allen, as he was called, had established a compound forhimself near Waikiki with a flock of two hundred goats that he sold to visitingships, a large number of dogs that he sold to Hawaiians for feasts, as well asa profitable business selling liquor. While Tyerman and Bennet rejoiced in theprosperity of this ‘poor African’, they nevertheless disapproved of hisactivities, particularly since selling alcohol was most profitable on Sundays,when sailors were allowed ashore.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 1 May, <em>the Prince Regent</em> was formallypresented to the King, but when Captain Kent prepared to lower the Britishcolours, Liholiho said he would continue to fly them – perhaps suggesting anorigins for the Hawai’ian flag. Having spent a month in the Sandwich Isles, themissionaries expected to resume their journey to the Marquesas in <em>theMermaid</em>, but were informed by Captain Kent that he would sail to FanningIsland (Tauaeran) to buy <em>béche de mer</em> to sell in China, butwould return later to collect them.</p>\n<p>Finding themselves at a loose end in Honolulu, Tyerman andBennet attempted to persuade the King to formally adopt Christianity. Visitingthe royal women, they found them dressed in a mixture of European and Hawaiianclothing, some wearing silk and calico gowns with feather tippets, while otherswore scarlet cloth about their loins with necklaces made from platted humanhair and whale’s tooth pendants.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup>Extremelyvaluable, one of these was later presented to the Missionary Museum by William Ellis.</p>\n<p>Tyerman and Bennet were told that Liholiho’s decision tooverturn the existing religious system had been partly prompted by the reportsof Hawai’ians returning from Britain, America and Australia, where their godswere not worshipped.

Conducting the service inHawai’ian, he baptised the Queen the day before she died, making her the firstHawai’ian noble to receive the Christian rite. Keōpūolani evidently asked for aChristian burial.

Ellis, however, had been a muchlonger-term resident in the places he wrote about. Beginning his account with aconsideration of the narrative of Captain Cook’s third voyage, with whichHawai’i was indissolubly connected in the English mind, he suggested this hadled many readers to imagine the islands were:</p>\n<p>a sort of elysium, where the highly-favoured inhabitants,free from the toil and care, the want and disappointments, which mar thehappiness of civilised communities, dwelt in what they called a state ofnature, and spent their lives in unrestrained gratification and enjoyment.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fnref45\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">45</a></sup></p>\n<p>While these accounts may have been ‘faithful transcripts ofthe first impressions’ made on the minds of Cook and his companions, Ellissuggested they were correct only ‘so far as their partial observationextended’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He argued thatthe arrival of ships and foreigners had been so important and surprising anevent that ordinary life was for a time suspended – the whole island beingdedicated to supplying the every need of the visiting sailors.</p>\n<p>Ellis suggested that the acquaintance of the previousgeneration with the islands and their people had ultimately been superficial incomparison to the eight years he had spent living in the Pacific, leading theminto mistaken inferences. Far different, he suggested were the impressionsproduced on the minds of the missionaries who have resided for some years inthe islands, acquired the language and observed nearly all aspects of life,government and religion.</p>\n<p>Nearly a century before the publication ofMalinowski’s <em>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</em>, William Ellis usedthe length of his stay and his linguistic abilities to establish his literaryauthority as an observer of Pacific life. He also used images, as well asartefacts, acquired during his travels, to buttress the text. Ellis usedfootnotes to refer the reader to specimens of lava and rocks (1826: 228), aswell as:</p>\n<p>Specimens of the principal kinds of native cloth,manufactured in the Sandwich Islands, may be seen in the Missionary Museum,Austin Friars.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While the published accounts of Tyerman, Bennet and Ellissuggest Hawai’ians were actively and enthusiastically acquiring, as well asemulating modern forms of clothing in the early 1820s, these visitors wereclearly equally fascinated by the bark cloth produced in the islands,collecting examples to take to take home to Europe.</p>\n<p>The footnote, cited above, from which this chapter takes itstitle, comes at the end of a fairly extended description of bark clothmanufacture that Ellis incorporated into his account of the 1823 tour ofHawai’i. Having seen people carrying bundles of branches of <em>wauke</em> (papermulberry or Broussoneia papyrifera), six to ten feet long and an inch indiameter, the missionaries watched on the morning of 17 July 1823 as Keoua, thewife of John Adams Kuakini, worked these with her attendants and about 40 otherwomen in the shade of a grove of trees:</p>\n<p>They first cut the bark, the whole length of the stick, witha sharp serrated shell, and having carefully peeled it off, rolled it intosmall coils, the inner bark being outside. In this state it is left some time,to make it flat and smooth. Keoa not only worked herself, but appears to takethe superintendence of the whole party. Whenever a fine piece of bark wasfound, it was shown to her, and put aside to be manufactured into <em>wairiirii,</em> orsome other particular cloth. With lively chat and cheerful song, they appearedto beguile the hours of labour until noon, when having finished their work,they repaired to their dwellings.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While this all that is recorded in the account published inBoston in 1825, Ellis used this episode to include several further pages ofdescription of the cultivation of <em>wauke</em> as well as themanufacturing process, listing the types of cloth made and comparing these tomuslin, dimity, and wash-leather in the expanded 1826 version.</p>\n<p>He described red and yellow painted examples were rubbedwith vegetable oil. perfumed with chips of sandal wood or the seeds of <em>pandanusodoratissima</em>, to make them water resistant. <em>Kapa moe</em> was atype of sleeping cloth, coloured white, yellow, brown or black and made fromseveral layers of <em>kapa</em> for the chiefs, while <em>kihei</em> wasmade in the same way but only the size of a shawl, commonly coloured white oryellow mixed with red and black and worn by men over one shoulder:</p>\n<p>But the best kind of cloth made with the cultivated plant isthe <em>wairiirii</em>, which is made into <em>paüs</em> for thefemales and <em>maros</em> for the men. The paüs are generally fouryards long, and about one yard wide, very thick, beautifully pained withbrilliant red, yellow, and black colours, and covered over with a fine gum andresinous varnish, which not only preserves the colours, but renders the clothimpervious and durable. The <em>maros</em> are about a foot wide andthree or four yards long.</p>\n<p>The colours they employ are procured from the leaves, bark,berries, or roots of indigenous plants, and require much skill in theirpreparation. One or two kinds of earth are also used in mixing the darkercolours. Since foreigners have visited them, they have found, upon trial, thatour colours are better than theirs, and the paint they purchase from ships hassuperseded in a great degree the native colours, in the painting of all themost valuable kinds of cloth.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Describing the techniques of printing using engraved bamboo,Ellis was keen that his readers appreciate the ingenuity and skill involvedin <em>kapa</em> production:</p>\n<p>The fabrication of it shews both invention and industry; andwhether we consider its different textures, its varied and regular patterns,its beautiful colours, so admirably preserved by means of the varnish, we areat once convinced, that the people who manufacture it are neither deficient intaste, nor incapable of receiving the improvements of civilised society.⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fnref50\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">50</a></sup></p>\n<p>At this point in the text, the footnote referred readers toexamples in the Missionary Museum they could convince themselves of thequality, industry and invention of cloth production with their own eyes.</p>\n<p>The framing of this observation is significant, using theskill inherent in existing forms of production to exemplify the potential forconversion and civilisation. There were many in British society who opposedmissionary activity on a number of different grounds, but Ellis seems keen toevoke artefactual evidence to refute those who would claim that there was nopoint in undertaking missionary work among people incapable of improvingthemselves.</p>\n<p>In the 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum, published inthe same year as Ellis’ account, we find further items that are mentioned inhis text. As well as the specimens of lava and examples of cloth, other itemslisted from the ‘Sandwich Islands’ include baskets used for keeping cloth(1826: 293), a decorated calabash (1826: 349), a <em>páhe</em> or dartused for gaming (1826: 169), as well as a pair of shoes made from bull’s hide,worn by Ellis on his tour (1826: 76). The catalogue also lists a dedicateddisplay case:</p>\n<p>containing a great variety of Articles, brought over by theRev. W. Ellis, most of which have a description attached to them. For a longeraccount see his work lately published.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Other items listed in the 1826 catalogue from the SandwichIslands  include two walking sticks, a shell blown to call people toschool and worship at Oahu, two pieces of wood for making fire and a smalldrum.</p>\n<p>Only one ‘idol’ from Hawai’i was listed – a feathered head‘in a glass case… formerly in Parkinson’s Museum’.  This was theLeverian collection, acquired by Parkinson through a lottery in 1786, but soldat auction in 1806. It seems very likely, then, that this was acquired inHawai’i on Captain Cook’s third voyage. Who presented it to the MissionaryMuseum is unknown.</p>\n<p>Further material, including the large wooden figure fromthe <em>marae</em> at Kairua Bay would eventually find its way toLondon with George Bennet later, and a note was added to the catalogue inexpectation of this:</p>\n<p>It is probably that we shall be able to give a moreparticular description of the South Sea Idols, and the articles, on the returnof the Deputation. Additional Specimens may also be expected.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1921, eleven years after the museum of the LondonMissionary Society had closed and a hundred years after Tyerman and Bennetarrived in the Pacific, the British Museum recorded a donation of eighteensamples bark cloth from the London Missionary Society. They arrived withvirtually no information about where they were originally from.</p>\n<p>Given that many have been identified on stylistic grounds asHawai’ian, it seems very likely that this collection constitutes what remainsof the specimens referred to by Ellis in 1826. Today they offer us afascinating glimpse into Hawai’ian society at a crucial moment of political andreligious transformation. Nevertheless, like William Ellis two centuries ago, Ican’t help being impressed by their visual beauty and the considerable skillthey manifest.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-c7-24\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-c7-24\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Illustration of a funeral procession by the sea, featuring solemn figures lined up with a cannon salute in the background.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/part-1/7/c7-24.png\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Engraving by Barker.

Tales told of people from the southeast with long hair and dark skins wielding sickle-like weapons, terrifying many who heard them. At first Robert Moffat, a young Scottish missionary, dismissed these tales as ‘mere fabrications’, but over time evidence accumulated that the so-called ‘Mantatees’ were rather more than figments of the imagination.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Moffat finally came face-to-face with a large group of these semi-mythical people on 25 June 1823, gathered outside the town of Old Lattakoo (Dithakong), in what is now South Africa’s Northern Cape. He spoke with an elderly man and his son who were part of the group, resting in the shade of a rock. They claimed to be dying of hunger and begged for meat. When the larger group became aware of the missionary, and perhaps more significantly the twelve armed Griqua men on horseback who accompanied him, they surrounded their herd of cattle for protection. Griqua scouts approached the group, but were greeted with a yell, followed by a hail of weapons.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Reinforced by a larger commando from Griqua Town (Klaarwater) the following day, another approach at sunrise met with the same response. At this point Andries Waterboer, the Kaptijn or leader at Griqua Town, began to shoot. Counter-attacks were made, but Moffat recorded in his journal that the enemy were reluctant to be parted from their cattle. Women mixed with men in the defence of the herds, with Moffat complaining that this made it impossible to avoid shooting them.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>After two and a half hours of battle with a mounted Griqua commando of around 100 supported by Bathlaping warriors firing poisoned arrows, ‘the Mantatees’, on foot and armed with only spears, clubs and axes, attempted to retreat. They made their way into the town which they set alight, perhaps in the hope of creating a distraction. The Griqua, however, pursued the retreating group for eight miles, capturing over 1000 head of cattle.</p>\n<p>Moffat recorded that between 400 and 500 ‘Mantatees’ were killed during seven hours of fighting, with only one Tswana combatant killed ‘perhaps from too much boldness in plunder’.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> The disparity in casualties makes it clear how decisive an advantage firearms and horses gave to the Griqua, compared with other groups operating in the African interior.</p>\n<p>Moffat’s eyewitness account of what has become known as ‘the Battle of Dithakong’, written in his journal but published in abridged form in the Missionary Chronicle soon after, in January 1824, is somewhat ambivalent.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He attempts to position himself as witness and bystander, but acknowledges that he was responsible for requesting the assistance of the Griqua when told of approaching ‘Mantatees’, as well as for supplying them with gunpowder.</p>\n<p>Moffat remained with the Griqua commando for his own safety, but was, by his own admission, far from being in command of these rather expert fighters. He claims not to have discharged a single shot ‘as fighting was not my province’, but remained implicated in the violent confrontation that unfolded as he watched.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Having worried about the shooting of women, he evidently became even more upset when Batlhaping warriors joined the fray, killing wounded men, women and children with spears and axes ’like voracious wolves’ with ‘savage ferocity… and severing the head from the body, for the sake of a few paltry rings’. Moffat states that he galloped among them to prevent this slaughter, inducing many women to sit on the ground, bare their breasts and cry ‘we are women’.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Moffat and the only other European present, John Melvill, a former Government Surveyor at the Cape who had given up a healthy salary to become a government agent at Griqua Town (and would later resign this post to become an LMS missionary), took responsibility for ‘collecting the prisoners’, mostly women and children, after the main body of Griquas ‘galloped forward, anxious to divide the spoil’ – the large herd of captured cattle. At this point, Moffat used italics to remark to his journal: They are heathens still.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Spoils of battle were not confined to cattle, however, and Moffat noted that the path taken by the retreating enemy was ‘thickly strewed with karosses, victuals, utensils, ornaments, and weapons, which the Bechuanas eagerly gathered up’.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> If Moffat was merely a witness to these scenes of plunder, as his journal implies, how did a number of items apparently taken at the battle, including ‘a Mantatese apron’, find their way to the Missionary Museum in London, and from there to the British Museum where they remain today?</p>\n<p>The Battle of Dithakong has come to assume a central place in historical understandings of a period violence, disruption and significant population displacement that unfolded across the interior of southern Africa during the 1820s, known widely as the mfecane or difaqane (depending on which southern Bantu language grouping is preferred). Eyewitness accounts of the battle, provided by both Moffat and Melvill, as well as by George Thompson, a Cape Town merchant involved in run up, though not at the battle itself, makes it one of the best documented conflicts of the period.</p>\n<p>After battles later in the century that saw both British troops and Boer voortrekkers on the losing side against Zulu regiments, historians widely connected the conflicts and migrations of the 1820s to the rise of the Zulu kingdom on South Africa’s southeast coast, under its most charismatic King, Shaka. If the history of the world was the biography of great men, then Shaka became a conquering African hero in the form most admired by Thomas Carlyle (1840) – a South African Napoleon.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1966, John Omer-Cooper, based for over a decade at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria where historians were attempting to write African history for its own sake as the country embraced independence, published The Zulu Aftermath, a synthetic work that attempted to Africanise South African history.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> According to one of his contemporaries, Omer-Cooper ‘sought to restore the dignity of Africans as positive actors in their history’.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Omer-Cooper presented the mfecane as an internally generated African revolution with little to do with European engagements in the region – an independent African history for an independent Africa.</p>\n<p>In 1988, Julian Cobbing, writing in South Africa in advance of the end of apartheid published a paper that attempted to upend this way of seeing things. In ’the Mfecane as Alibi’, Cobbing suggested that the notion of the mfecane was a construction of settler history that framed the depopulation of South Africa’s landscape in terms of black-on-black violence in order to justify its occupation by incoming settlers. He pointed out the ways in which it had been propagated ‘with unbelievable rapidity’ through South African universities, schools, the press, television and cinema after 1970 (Shaka Zulu, a major TV series produced by the South AfricanBroadcasting Corporation, first aired in 1986).⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>For Cobbing the ‘Afrocentrism’ of the mfecane myth conformed to a pattern – in South Africa’s historical texts whites and blacks were covered in separate chapters with their interactions ‘generally ignored’. As Marxism, in the form of dialectical materialism, came to dominate the theoretical imaginations of many South African scholars during the 1970s and 80s, the idea of ‘a purely internal revolution in ‘Bantu Africa’’’ came to seem increasingly naive – reinforcing the apartheid state’s continued efforts to maintain distinct administrative and conceptual frameworks to account for its variously racialised citizens and subjects.</p>\n<p>For Cobbing, the ‘motor of change… was not a self-generated internal revolution with a short time-scale, but rather European penetration, against which black societies threw up a series of complex reactive states, that matured over a much longer period of time’.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup>  While many of Cobbing’s arguments focused on the details on Zulu history, he deployed the Battle of Dithakong as a pivot ‘on which to hinge a case study’ to test and challenge the assumptions of mfecane theory.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Cobbing argued that the ‘battle’ was an unprovoked ‘slave (and cattle) raid’ that amounted to a ‘seven-hour massacre’.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> He suggested that a shortage of labour in the Cape, following the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, the exclusion from the Colony of ‘black’ labourers in 1809, and the arrival of British settlers in 1820 made battle captives, particularly women and young boys, extremely valuable.  According to Cobbing:</p>\n<p>The missionaries tried to depict themselves as succouring the prisoners, and rescuing them from the evil chiefs and starvation (with all those cattle?). There is no doubt, however, that they were fully and consciously engrossed in what they were doing, i.e. collecting slaves, and that the cover of hypocrisy was intended to deflect the certain censure from the government in London and from their seniors in the London Missionary Society if it has leaked out that they were selling people into slavery.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Re-reading Moffat’s account of the battle thirty-five years after Cobbing published his paper and twenty-five years after I first encountered it on my undergraduate reading list, I remain far from convinced that the missionary was ‘consciously engrossed’ in capturing slaves, however much he may have struggled to account for the events in which he played a part. Moffat was certainly no saint – he regularly came into conflict with others while forcefully pursuing his own agendas – but I remain unconvinced that re-casting him as a villain helps us to better understand the conflict or its wider implications for African history.</p>\n<p>While I recognise that an entirely ‘Afrocentric’ framing of the violence of the 1820s is potentially naive, both historically and politically, I can’t help feeling that making Europeans the sole ‘motor of change’ potentially reiterates a narrative of African victimhood, denying a right of self-determination in relation to the way Africans responded to historical events.</p>\n<p>In the context of recent battles around the focus and meaning of ‘decolonisation’, Olúfémi Táíwo has pointed to the risk that ‘making European colonisation the pole around which we build our explanatory and narrative structures’ can mean we fail to take African agency seriously.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> There were, after all, many Africans on both sides of the battle that day, but only two Europeans.</p>\n<p>As I try to make sense of what happened at Dithakong on 26 June 1823, I return to the surviving textual accounts. Is it possible that Robert Moffat found himself caught in the crossfire of historical forces, and wrote in his journal to figure out what had just happened and what it meant, just as I am also trying to do two centuries later?</p>\n<p>I also return to the artefacts that were associated with ‘the Mantatees’ at the Missionary Museum. Are these straightforward trophies – looted from the field of battle as plunder, as Cobbing’s framing of the battle might suggest? Or are they something a little more ambivalent – a form of evidence that anchors the textual accounts, becoming an alternative source to be consulted even while a degree of uncertainty about exactly who ‘the Mantatees’ were, and what they were doing at Dithakong remains.</p>\n<p>Ambiguous and ambivalent, their digital images continue to bear witness to an event around which competing narratives continue to swirl. Perhaps in order to better assess the reliability of Robert Moffat’s account, we need to know a little about who he was and what he was doing at Dithakong in the first place.</p>\n<p>Born at Ormiston in Scotland in 1795, Moffat spent a period at sea as a cabin boy before being apprenticed to a gardener at the age of fourteen. Working at an estate in Cheshire, he became involved with the Methodist movement, ultimately coming under the influence of William Roby, minister of the Grosvenor Street Congregational Church in Manchester. Roby arranged for Moffat to be employed at a garden nursery in the city in 1816, while he prepared for life as a missionary.</p>\n<p>In September 1816, Moffat travelled to the headquarters to of the London Missionary Society, where according to a letter he sent to his parents:</p>\n<p>I spent some time in viewing the museum, which contains a great number of curiosities from China, Africa, South Seas and West Indies. It would be foolish for me to give you a description. Suffice it to say that the sight is truly awful, the appearance of the wild beasts is terrific, but I am unable to describe the sensations of my mind when gazing on the objects of pagan worship. Alas! how fallen my fellow-creatures, bowing down to forms enough to frighten a Roman soldier, enough to shake the hardest heart. Oh that I had a thousand lives, and a thousand bodies: all of them should be devoted to no other employment but to preach Christ to these degraded, despised, yet beloved mortals. I had not repented in becoming a missionary, and should I die in the march, and never enter the field of battle, all will be well.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The recently opened museum clearly served to reinforce, if not inspire, the commitment of aspiring missionaries such as Moffat. At a service on 30 September involving John Campbell, the ‘African traveller’, Moffat was dedicated for missionary service alongside eight others, four for the Pacific (including John Williams) and four others for South Africa. On 18 October, he sailed for South Africa on the Alacrity, arriving at Cape Town in January 1817.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Permission to leave the colony was refused by the Governor, who was concerned that Griqua Town was becoming a place of refuge for servants and slaves fleeing the colony, so Moffat lodged at a wine farm in Stellenbosch where he learned Dutch until he received permission to go to Namaqualand the following September.</p>\n<p>Moffat arrived at the kraal of Jager Afrikaner (literally African Hunter) in late January 1818. A métis group of Khoe descent, much like the Griqua, Afrikaner’s people had a reputation as raiders and rustlers who traded cattle and ivory with the Colony from the lands beyond. Jager was an outlaw with a price on his head, having killed the white farmer by whom the group had originally been employed (and with whom they had engaged in raids).</p>\n<p>Three German missionaries, recruited by Johannes Kicherer during his visit to Europe, had begun work with Afrikaner’s people in 1805. One of these, Johannes Seidenfaden, later memorably described as ‘a wolf in sheep’s clothing’, seems to have set about enriching himself from the proceeds of Afrikaner’s ivory trade with the Cape, which provided the guns and powder necessary for hunting and raiding.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1811, Jäger Afrikaner raided Seidenfaden’s mission station at Pella, pillaging his house and taking a barrel of gunpowder and a pair of guns, forcing the missionaries to retreat to Cape Town. Following a visit by John Campbell in 1813, a mission was re-established with Afrikaner in 1815, and in July of that year he was baptised – an event the historian Nigel Penn has regarded as marking the beginning of a a process of closure for the Cape colony’s northern frontier.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1819, Robert Moffat arranged for Afrikaner to travel to Cape Town, where he displayed his credentials as an exemplary convert, in the process being awarded a wagon and the right to enter the colony by the governor.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup> While in Cape Town, Moffat met John Campbell and John Philip, fellow Scots who had been sent by the Directors of the LMS to adjudicate in a complicated set of grievances brought by a new generation of missionaries, including Moffat, against the older guard.</p>\n<p>Campbell and Philip persuaded Moffat not to abandon his missionary calling, but rather to accompany them as an interpreter on a journey of inspection while he awaited the arrival of his intended bride, whose parents had finally agreed that she could make the journey from Manchester. Having visited Bethelsdorp and other mission stations in the East of the colony, Moffat and Philip returned to Cape Town where they met Mary on her arrival in December 1819 (her own inspiration for missionary work came from hearing John Campbell speaking in Manchester about his first journey to South Africa).⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup></p>\n<p>Robert and Mary were married 19 days later, and it was decided that Moffat should take over the mission at New Lattakoo (Maruping) – James Read, originally stationed at Bethelsdorp with Vanderkemp in 1799, had taken himself there in self-imposed exile after admitting to charges of sexual impropriety.</p>\n<p>The Moffats travelled north with John Campbell early in 1820, arriving at Griqua Town late in the evening on 13 March where they found men making square buildings out of stone and women ‘dressed in European fashion’ sewing cotton clothes. While there, a wagon arrived with a party of thirty Batlhaping led by a Griqua missionary, Jan Hendric, who taking ivory to trade at a market arranged at the edge of the Cape Colony at Beaufort West, 500km to the South.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 21 March, Campbell and the Moffats set off for Kuruman, and on their journey encountered more people taking skins, assegais, knives, shields to trade for beads at fair. Campbell noticed that compared to his journey four years earlier, wild game had become much scarcer due to the hunting activities of Griqua and their guns.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Arriving at the mission, they found a row of missionary houses behind a neat reed fence, with gardens at the back, as well as a church capable of holding four hundred people. They had brought a bell to be hung near the church to replace the horn used previously to summon people to worship.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup></p>\n<p>They were visited at the home off Robert Hamilton by the King or Kgosi, Mothibi, as well as various other nobles , who were presented with gifts ranging from snuff, beads and buttons to tinder-boxes and kaleidoscopes. Moffat bargained for a two gallon wooden container, made by the neighbouring Bakwena, while some of the visitors amused themselves examining portraits from the Evangelical Magazine displayed on the walls, including one of Campbell himself.</p>\n<p>Campbell expressed his satisfaction that under the influence of James Read, Mothibi had ceased the system of commandoes to raid cattle from neighbouring groups, but Mothibi pointed out that without this source of income, he needed guns and gunpowder to hunt wild animals.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Campbell and Read departed on a journey to the North, visiting Dithakong as well as the substantial city of Kaditshwene – but also meeting Campbell’s old friend Cupido Kakkerlak then serving as a missionary to the Coranna – the Moffats stayed at Maruping to establish relationships at what would become their new station.</p>\n<p>In the meantime Jager Afrikaner arrived with a wagon of Moffat’s belongings, including many books. When Campbell returned to the colony with Read, much to the displeasure of the residents of Maruping, the Moffats went for a time to Griqua Town, before joining Hamilton permanently at the mission in May 1821, still in their mid-twenties.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was at in the course of attempting a journey of his own to the Tswana towns of the North-East that Moffat met reports that invading Mantatees close at hand had in fact overrun many of these towns, including Kaditshwene. Fearing for the safety of his young family, he returned to Maruping to decide on a course of action. While the Batlhaping prepared for war, Moffat rode to Griqua Town to request assistance.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On June 13 1823, a pitsho or parliament of armed men, assembled. One old man exhorted the crowd by telling them it was the pitsho of the missionary, and as such they should speak and act not like Batswana but like Makgoas (white people). The Makgoas, meanwhile, buried their possessions so that they could make a quick escape.⁠⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup></p>\n<p>uccess in repelling the invading ‘Mantatees’ seems to have marked a significant material change for both the Moffat household, by then featuring two very young children, and the mission of which they formed a part. In a letter to Mary’s parents dated 23 July 1823, from Griqua Town less than a month after the battle, Robert Moffat declared that four of the ‘prisoners’ were ‘inmates’ of his family:</p>\n<p>Mason or Mahum (Mmahuma), a woman about 25 yeas of age; Moshanee, also a woman, rather older; Fahaange, a boy, about eight years old; and a girl about four (Niywe). Mary has made Mahum, cook, and Moshanee nurse and washerwoman; and the boy, who seems clever, I shall find useful. Considering their former savage state, they do exceedingly well. Moshanee makes a good nurse, and helps to wash very well. This is a great comfort to Mary, as washing is her greatest hardship in this climate. They seem very happy in their new situation, and pleased with their clothes…⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Returning to Maruping in August, Moffat found his garden destroyed but much of his former home in a better state than expected. He subsequently rescued another starving refugee be found being beaten with stones by some boys, taking her to his kitchen where he gave her food and clothing.</p>\n<p>The provision of food and clothes allowed Moffat to present the ‘Mantatees’ as the recipients of charity, but their deployment as supplementary household labour – feeding and washing the Moffat family – suggests that the relationship was rather more complicated. Indeed, their exact status seems to have been fairly ambiguous – the fact that Moffat refers to them as ‘prisoners’ and ‘inmates’ seems significant.</p>\n<p>Moffat used his newfound influence to argue for the mission’s relocation to a reedy valley eight miles closer to the spring at Kuruman known as Seodin – a seemingly ideal location for someone trained as a gardener. Kgosi Mothibi agreed to grant two miles of the valley adjacent to the island to the missionaries, noting that their presence might provide protection for his cattle from raiding nearby ‘bushmen’.</p>\n<p>These arrangements having been made in principle, Moffat set off for Cape Town in October 1823 to seek approval from LMS superintendent John Philip, with a promise to return with the necessary goods for a remuneration – variously described as 40lbs of beads or a small sum of around £5.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Moffat took with him Kgosi Mothibi’s son and heir, Phetlu, as well as an advisor, Thaišo, who became celebrities at the Cape. They visited the city’s famous castle, its schools as well as the museum, a year before its official establishment. George Thompson, who had met them during preparations for the battle, commissioned their portraits by a recently arrived English artist, Henry Clifford de Meillon. Phetlu and Thaišo seem to have been struck by the ships, but were especially pleased when presented with two guns and some powder by the Governor, who they told ‘had made their hearts white’.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It was presumably from Cape Town that Moffat forwarded a series of items to the Missionary Museum, had so impressed him just over seven years earlier. These were listed in the Catalogue of the Missionary Museum, printed in 1826 with a description on page 38:</p>\n<p>NECK RINGS, used by the Chiefs’ wives of the Mantantese.</p>\n<p>The nation is very remote in the interior of South Africa, about 40,000 of whom left their country on a plundering expedition, pillaging all the counties through which they passed, till they reached the city of Lattakoo, in the neighbourhood of which they were repulsed. On this occasion, these rings, with various other articles, were taken. The four rings were worn by one female.</p>\n<p>COPPER ORNAMENTS, worn by the same nation.⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In addition, the following items featured as part of a list of material from a shelf on page 42:</p>\n<ol start=\"29\">\n<li>\n<p>A COPPER RING, from the Mantantese.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Mantantese NEEDLE.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Mantantese KNIFE.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Mantantese APRON.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A later version of the catalogue, printed around 1860 listed the same apron as:</p>\n<p>A Manatee female apron of iron beads. – Presented by Rev. R. Moffat</p>\n<p>While it seems likely that this was picked up on the field of battle, it remains possible that it was given to Moffat by one of the women who was taken into his household when they were provided with European clothes. This ambiguity parallels the ambiguous legal status of the women. Were they refugees or captives, enslaved or free?</p>\n<p>As well as these ‘Mantatee’ artefacts, Moffat seems to have taken five ‘Mantatee’ women and a boy with him to Cape Town. While there are no surviving individual portraits like those of Phetlu and Thaišo, George Thompson’s 1827 account of his Travels and Adventures in Southern Africa does include a vignette of ‘Mantatee Portraits’ at the beginning of Chapter XVI. A footnote on p.320 states that they were rescued by Messrs. Melvill, Hamilton and Moffat:</p>\n<p>The female, by name Mahum, has a mild and pleasing countenance, as, indeed, most of the Mantatee females have, indicating nothing of cannibal ferocity. She is now in Cape Town, and has proved herself a very good and faithful servant.</p>\n<p>The other figure is that of a boy about nine years of age, named Tahana. He was saved by Mr. Moffat, and having lost all his own relatives, has become affectionately domesticated in the family of his benefactor.</p>\n<p>A report in the Missionary Chronicle for November 1824 suggests that their status remained uncertain within the colony, since when travelling through Stellenbosch, the Mantatee women, walking at a small distance from the wagon were arrested by two constables and taken to prison. When missionaries appealed to the Landdrost the following morning, the women were released. However, it does not seem to have been the constables alone who were unclear about the legal status of these women within the colony.</p>\n<p>When asked about the captives from the battle at an enquiry on 20 April 1824, Moffat declared that rather than being captives:</p>\n<p>the women and children, who were left on the field, abandoned and famished, were offered protection, which many of them accepted, to save their lives; and it was explained to them by Mr. Melville and myself, that they had the option of following in search of their tribe, or of remaining; a few went away, but the greater part remained on the field, and a few came with us; these were taken into the houses of those Griquas who were able to provide for them. It will probably now have been settled on what footing they are to remain with them.</p>\n<p>Mr. Melville sent some of them to Graaf Rennet… The Mantatee women, I have understood, were distributed in the colony amongst the Boors, but upon what footing I do not know. The Griquas entrusted to bring them into the colony received 100 rix dollars from the landdrost…</p>\n<p>I brought six into the colony. Three were left with Mr. Baird at Beaufort, from my knowledge of the care he would take of them, and two are in the care of Dr. Philip. One I brought down, at the request of Mr. Melville, for his sister; but as she had died I made this woman over to Mr Melville’s father-in-law, who I remember to have exposed his intention of having her booked in; but I admonished him that the woman was free, not understanding what he meant by booking in.</p>\n<p>Robert Moffat may not have thought he was engaged in a slave raid, but that clearly doesn’t mean that everyone else, including the ‘Mantatee women’ themselves, regarded things that way. He declared in 1824 that the Botswana ‘have a servile class, but no slaves’, but quite how the captives of battle expected to be treated remains unclear from a distance of two centuries.</p>\n<p>In 1823, slavery continued to exist within the Cape Colony although the 1807 abolition of the slave trade had cut off the supply of enslaved people to this largely plantation-based economy. How different in practice, if perhaps not in law, was the status of the young orphaned Tahana when ‘affectionately domesticated in the family of his benefactor’, to that of someone who had been formally enslaved?</p>\n<p>Does it make a difference today whether the metal apron was taken from the body of someone who was alive or dead, or indeed whether it was taken by Moffat himself or rather by an African combatant?</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>⁠⁠<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup>: Schapera, I. 1951.

The Rev. Dr. David Bogue, however, directed the meeting’s attention to the achievements of two of his former students, Dr Robert Morrison and Dr William Milne, who had recently produced a translation of the Bible into Chinese:</p>\n<p>By their labours the Scriptures are rendered intelligible to some hundreds of millions of the human race. Strange! (Said Dr. B.) strange! That 1800 years should have been suffered to elapse before the Bible should be translated into the language of the most numerous class of people of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Three decades earlier, Bogue’s appeal <em>To the evangelical dissenters who practice infant baptism</em> had led to the establishment of the Missionary Society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> He had personally volunteered for missionary service in India in 1796, along with his former student Robert Haldane, but they had been blocked by the East India Company. Having studied Divinity at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, Bogue thought missionaries needed a rigorous education, including a working knowledge of Greek, Latin and Hebrew, to allow them to translate the Bible, which he felt was more important than preaching, at least initially.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the early years of the Missionary Society, Bogue’s vision came up against that of Thomas Haweis, an Oxford-educated Anglican from Cornwall, who thought it sufficient to despatch ‘godly mechanics’ as missionaries. Haweis’ approach eventually bore fruit after two decades with the conversion of Pomare at Tahiti by the bricklayer Henry Nott (chapter 4). During the Society’s first decade, however, many ‘godly mechanics’ abandoned their stations in Tahiti and South Africa prompting the Directors to reconsider their approach.</p>\n<p>In 1800 Bogue was made responsible for training prospective missionaries at his Gosport Academy in Hampshire, where he had trained Independent Ministers since 1789. Robert Morrison was one of the early missionary students, arriving in 1804.</p>\n<p>Two decades later, Morrison sat listening to Bogue’s speech, having recently returned from China. At the prompting of others, he stood to address the meeting, holding a letter of instructions he had been given by the Society’s treasurer, Joseph Hardcastle, in early 1807:</p>\n<p>At that period I was considered a Lay-Missionary, – a sort of mathematician sent to gain, if practicable, a residence in yonder region. The acquisition of the language was thought scarcely possible; though a faint hope was entertained that it might be acquired, and that a Dictionary might be composed, and the Holy Scripture might be translated in Chinese; and now, after 17 years residence in that country, I stand here before God and before you this day, and would our esteemed friend were yet on earth to witness our laying before the Society the scarcely anticipated result of this undertaking.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Morrison then presented a copy of the Bible along with ‘a copy of the Chinese and English Dictionary’ to the assembled London Missionary Society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Morrison was clear that ultimate credit for his achievements rested with God. Nevertheless, the success of his mission to China, and particularly his production of the Dictionary, suggest credit was also owed to Britain’s premier joint-stock company, the East India Company, with which he formed a strategic alliance.</p>\n<p>Morrison arrived back in London in March 1824, stopping briefly at Cape Town on his way from China, where he met Robert Moffat (another of Bogue’s former students), presumably with his ‘Mantatee’ captives (Chapter 8). Morrison was himself accompanied on the journey by a Chinese servant, ‘Poon a Sam’, referred to by Bogue in his speech as ‘a Christian Chinese whom we are delighted to see amongst us this day’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Intriguingly, the <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum,</em> printed two years later in 1826, lists a number of items presented by ‘A Sam’ including a pair of shoes, Chinese combs and a brush, two curiously carved coconut cups, as well as the Chinese cup used by Morrison.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This chapter’s title also comes from the four-page ‘CHINA’ section, two-thirds of the way through the <em>Catalogue</em>. Although a number of Chinese ‘idols’ are listed at the beginning of the section, it also includes a type of artefact unlike most others in the <em>Catalogue</em> – printed books. The first to be listed, in a section describing the contents of ‘the fourth shelf’, is Morrison’s ‘<em>Chinese and English dictionary</em>’. This is followed by two of his other books: <em>‘Grammar of the Chinese Language’</em> (1815) and a ‘<em>A View of China for Philological Purposes’ (1817)</em>. Only then is his bible translation listed as:</p>\n<p>A <em>COPY of the SACRED SCRIPTURES of the Old and New Testament, translated into the Chinese language by the indefatigable labours of Dr. Robert Morrison, assisted in part of the work, by the late Dr. Milne, of Malacca.</em></p>\n<p><em>By this great achievement, many millions of the human race may be enlightened in the knowledge of God our Saviour.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This, however, is followed by listings for <em>Four Books on Drawing, published by the Chinese</em> and <em>A Work of Agriculture, &amp;c.</em>‘concerning the husbandry and the cultivation of Silk’ encouraged by Emperor Kang-Hi (Kangxi). Unlike South Africa and Tahiti, where there was no established form of writing, China had its own history of textual production. Indeed, Bogue seems to have felt that literacy was an important marker of ‘civilisation’, necessitating an approach to missionary work that was rooted in textual production.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Chinese books in the Missionary Museum may have formed a small part of the library of nearly 10,000 Chinese books which Morrison brought with him from China. It is curious, particularly perhaps for a Protestant missionary society, that the ‘Sacred Scriptures’ appear to be sandwiched between works on the Chinese language and others on drawing and agriculture, given the emphasis given to ‘this great achievement’ with its potential for conveying ‘the knowledge of God our Saviour’.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this ordering reflects the arrangement of the volumes on the shelf, with the bible displayed at its centre. It may also be progressive, suggesting that it was Morrison’s dictionary and grammar that ultimately enabled his translation of the <em>Sacred Scriptures</em>. In any case, it is significant that the dictionary and the bible translation were presented to the Society together in May 1824, and continued to be displayed alongside each other at the museum, since these two major works competed for Morrison’s time and attention over nearly two decades.</p>\n<p>While the Bible translation was funded by the London Missionary Society, with contributions from the British and Foreign Bible Society (established by a similarly non-denominational group of evangelicals in 1804), the three-volume 4,826 page dictionary, printed in six parts between 1815 and 1823, was funded exclusively by the East India Company, to the tune of over £10,000.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Given that the East India Company was officially opposed to the operation of Christian missionaries, as potentially disruptive to trade, how was Morrison able to serve these two masters?</p>\n<p>Born in 1782 at Morpeth in Northumberland in the far north of England, Morrison was the youngest of eight children. His father had been a Scottish farm labourer who moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne to work as a shoe-tree maker. Following an apprenticeship with his father, Morrison applied to train as a minister, moving to London to study at the Hoxton Academy at the age of twenty. In early 1804 he applied to become a missionary and was sent to Bogue’s Gosport Academy to complete his training. Morrison hoped he might go with Mungo Park to Timbuktu in Africa, and prayed that God send him ‘to some situation where he will make me abundantly useful to the souls of men’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1805, the London Missionary Society directors outlined a plan to send missionaries to Prince of Wales Island (Penang – under East India Company control since 1786), where it was hoped they would learn Chinese with the aim of translating the Bible.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Morrison began to learn Chinese with Yong Samtak (Rong Sande) from Canton (Guangzhou), who had come to London on an East India Company ship to learn English. Together they transcribed <em>Evangelia Quatuor Sinica</em>, a manuscript copy of a harmony of the gospels in Chinese, made by Jesuits in the 18<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> century, which had recently been found at the British Museum.</p>\n<p>Ordained in early 1807, Morrison left London at the end of January with two missionaries bound for India. Since the East India Company, which held a trading monopoly in China, refused to carry missionaries in their ships, they sailed first to New York. On arrival, Morrison went to Philadelphia to meet American missionary supporters in the hope they could provide him with a letter of introduction to the American Consul at Canton, the only place Europeans were permitted to trade in China after 1757.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sailing in mid-May, Morrison arrived at the Thirteen Factories in September 1807, having briefly met English residents at Macau, approximately 60km to the South near the mouth of the Pearl River. They told him the Chinese were forbidden from teaching outsiders on pain of death, and that working in Macau would be difficult on account of Catholic resentments in this Portuguese-controlled entrepôt. Morrison’s letter of instruction from Hardcastle made it clear that, many months travel from London, he was at ‘liberty to act on every occasion according to the dictates of your own prudence and discretion’, suggesting he find employment as a mathematician or teacher of English.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Morrison found lodgings in the old French Factory, under the supervision of American traders. The First American ships had arrived in 1784, shortly after the treat of Paris granted independence to the United States, and by the time Morrison arrived the major trade good they brought was sandalwood from Hawai’i and other Pacific islands (Chapter seven). Morrison, pretending to be American, worked secretly to learn Chinese, with assistance from Yin Kwan-ming (Abel Yin), a Chinese Catholic from Peking (Beijing). He was also taught Cantonese by Le Sëensang (Li Xiansheng), a Catholic whose father had undergone priestly training with Jesuits in Portugal  for twelve years.</p>\n<p>In November 1807, before the Missionary Museum was established in London, Morrison sent a number of curiosities back to Joseph Hardcastle. These included a figure of Kwan-yin (one of these is the first item listed in the CHINA section of the 1826 catalogue of the Missionary Museum), three weapons used by Malays (three KRIS from JAVA are listed in the 1826 catalogue), a pair of wooden sandals, as well as paintings ‘illustrative of the idolatry of this benighted people’. He also sent a book – a history of China which he asked be sent to the Royal Society, since he knew no copy was then available in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Morrison asked Hardcastle to send him copies of the Missionary Magazine, a little more money (he found living as a European in Canton  exorbitant), as well as some striped pocket handkerchiefs – ‘a very acceptable present to the Chinese’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> By December 1807, Morrison had acquired between four and five hundred volumes in Chinese on language, religion, philosophy, medicine, laws and history. Partly for financial reasons, Morrison initially adopted Chinese styles of dress and food, but came to see this ultimately made him more conspicuous, living as he was among the European and American traders within the restricted factory zone.</p>\n<p>In June 1808, Morrison travelled to the English factory at Macao, 100 miles to the South, remaining for three months to improve his health. He was, at that time, assisted to find a house by the chief of the English factory and representative of the East India Company, John Roberts, to enable his work on a Chinese Dictionary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In October, the English were expelled from Canton after East India Company troops occupied Macao, ostensibly to protect it from the French, so Morrison returned to Macao but seems to have felt he would soon need to move to Penang, as originally proposed.</p>\n<p>While at Macao, however, Morrison formed a close friendship with the evangelically minded Morton family from Ireland, recently arrived traders, and on 20 February 1809 he married Mary Morton, their eldest daughter. On the same day he was offered a post as Chinese Translator and Secretary for the East India Company’s Factory at Canton, with a salary of £500 a year. This provided him with an official position, allowing him to continue studying the language, working on the Chinese Dictionary, while continuing his translation of the bible privately. When informed of these developments, the Missionary Society’s representatives divined the gracious hand of God.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By September 1810, Morrison had revised a translation of the Acts of the Apostles based on the manuscript in London, and had 1000 copies printed secretly. By the end of the same year he revised a translation of Luke’s gospel, which he also printed locally. Writing from London in March 1812, Hardcastle and Burder thanked Morrison for the three copies of his translation of Acts which he had sent them, noting:</p>\n<p>we could have wished the number had been larger, for the sake of gratifying some of our friends in the country, and the Directors hope that when you shall have printed another portion of the Sacred Word they shall receive at least two dozen copies. One of the three with which you favoured us was presented by us to the British and Foreign Bible Society, who kindly voted £500 towards the important object of printing the Sacred Scriptures in the Chinese language; and another copy was ordered to be unstitched for distribution among the friends of the Society in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, who have expressed themselves gratified, in no small degree, to behold the first-fruits of the labours of their missionary in China, on whose behalf the prayers of thousands have been, doubtless, thereby excited.</p>\n<p>As a specimen of Chinese typography, it could not fail to excite more than ordinates attention as an oriental curiosity; but, to the eye of every friend of missions, it presented an ocular demonstration of the existence of the Book of Books in the language of so large a portion of the human race.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> We especially rejoice in hearing that the improvement in the art of printing, by means of stereotype, is not confined to Europe, but that from your wood-cut characters you are assured that, by occasionally retouching them when necessary, a hundred thousand copies may be procured.</p>\n<p>While the adoption of stereotype printing – using a single solid printing block for each page of text – was a new technology in Europe that was in the process of replacing plates composed from individual letters of moveable type, the technique used by Morrison’s Chinese printers was far from new.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Indeed, woodblock printing, with each page of text composed on a carved wooden block, dated back over a thousand years in China.</p>\n<p>When Morrison completed printing Luke’s gospel he only sent one copy to London, perhaps because he felt that as a book it would be more valuable to those who could actually read it. Nevertheless, the Society’s representatives in London were mindful of the propaganda value of ‘ocular proof’ of Morrison’s work of translation, even if it meant unbinding books so that individual pages could be circulated to supporters.</p>\n<p>The same letter, written in March 1812, updated Morrison with news of fellow missionaries in Africa and the Pacific, informing him that he would soon be joined by a missionary colleague, William Milne, a Scot, recommended by Dr Bogue.</p>\n<p>In 1812, the Chinese Emperor expelled four Catholic missionaries from Peking (Beijing) and issued an edict which made printing books in Chinese on the Christian religion a capital crime. Morrison began to think that missionary work in China needed an institution to train Chinese missionaries in the Malayan archipelago, where a mission press could print translations and tracts beyond the influence of the Emperor.</p>\n<p>In September 1812, the Rev. William Milne and his wife left Britain, arriving in Macao in early July the following year. As a result of lobbying by the Catholic bishop, the council at Macao declared that he could not stay, so he went to Canton alone, European women not being allowed at the Thirteen Factories. Finding Canton challenging without an association with the East India Company, Milne travelled to Java, Malacca and Penang, all then under British control, to find a suitable location to establish a mission, returning to Canton in September 1813.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile. the East India Company despatched a printer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Perring_Thoms\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Perring Thoms</a>, who arrived in China in September 1814 with a press and the necessary equipment to begin printing Morrison’s Chinese dictionary. Thoms was paid £300 a year by the Company, working with local assistants who cut Chinese fonts in tin alloy. 1814 saw the completion of Morrison’s translation of the New Testament, based on the manuscript at the British Museum, but also the baptism of his first convert, Tsae Tia A-Ko (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cai_Gao\" target=\"_blank\">Cai Gao</a>), one of the type-cutters.</p>\n<p>In 1815 Morrison’s <em>Chinese Grammar</em> was printed by the Mission Press at Serampore in India, funded by the East India Company, while Thoms began printing the first part of the first volume of his dictionary. The ongoing ill-health of Mary, Morrison’s wife meant that she travelled to London early that year, together with their two young children. In April, Morrison was once again left alone, when the Milnes left to establish what was called the Ultra Ganges Mission. Malacca was chosen as the best location mostly because of its centrality to areas of Chinese settlement in the Malay archipelago, but also due to its relatively healthy climate and maritime connections to both India and Canton.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ongoing persecution of Christians in China meant that those employed cutting Chinese types for Morrison’s dictionary were seized by the authorities, and in alarm, the book-seller who held the wooden printing blocks for a small edition of his New Testament destroyed them. The Directors of the Missionary Society asked Morrison whether it was cheaper to print his bible translation using the Chinese method with wooden blocks, or with moveable metal types. Morrison seems to have discussed the matter with the Company’s printer, Thoms, ‘who is daily in use of single metal types’ for the Dictionary. According to Morrison, in a reply written in November 1815, if metal stereotype is cheaper than the letter press in Europe, wooden blocks in China are ‘much cheaper than English stereotype’ since a Chinese ‘type-cutter requires only a fair copy’ while English stereotypes had to be cast from pages that were first composed with moveable type:</p>\n<p>The single letters in Chinese being so numerous, and arranged under no fewer than 214 radicals, though each character be a word, it requires more time to find any given word than is necessary to compose it from the Roman letter. A word from a Greek case, with all its accents, would be composed sooner than a Chinese character, from a collection of thirty or forty thousand characters, arranged in the best possible manner.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Morrison estimated that cutting the Chinese characters for the New Testament would cost 800 dollars, when his wood blocks only cost 500 dollars. He also thought that Chinese printers were able to print many more copies a day, and be paid less than European printers. Using the local technique meant that copies of the bible could be printed from the wooden blocks as and when they were needed, with no involvement from Morrison:</p>\n<p>I am myself fully convinced that all than can be said in favour of metal stereotype for printing standard books, applies with fully as much, if not with greater force and truth, to the Chinese wooden stereotype.</p>\n<p>According to Milne, writing from Malacca in December 1815:</p>\n<p>As to the beauty of the <em>impression</em>, which is certainly the very least consideration, the advantage is in favour of the blocks. All Chinese printing with <em>moveable types,</em> even with regularly <em>cast</em> types, that I have yet seen, looks like the work of <em>foreigners</em>, and possesses not that freedom which the Chinese method has. To the Chinese, books printed with moveable types, have a certain awkward stiffness in their appearance.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In October 1815 Morrison received discouraging news – as a result of the Missionary Society publicity surrounding his ongoing translation work, something undertaken outside of his employment, the East India Company’s Court of Directors in London had sent orders that he be dismissed. This was essentially ignored by the Company representatives in China, given how essential Morrison’s translation skills had become to their commercial and diplomatic negotiations in Canton.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, during the second half of 1816 Morrison accompanied a British diplomatic mission to the Qing court in Peking (Beijing), led by Lord Amherst. Ultimately, Amherst refused to kowtow before the emperor and was refused entry to the imperial city. The journey, however, gave Morrison many opportunities to observe life in Imperial China, contributing to his <em>View of China for Philological Purposes,</em> subsequently printed in Macao by Thoms.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Meanwhile at Malacca, in November 1816, Milne baptised <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liang_Fa\" target=\"_blank\">Liang Fa</a>, a Chinese printer who went there with him the previous year.</p>\n<p>By early 1817, the mission press at Malacca had printed 9000 copies of the New Testament. In June of that year, the Ultra Ganges Mission was reinforced by the arrival a Walter Henry Medhurst, an experienced young printer from London. While work on Bible translation was strengthened by the establishment of a printing workshop at Milne’s mission at Malacca, work on the dictionary in Canton was slowed when its types were seized by Chinese authorities when one of the workmen took a sheet of the Dictionary to the Chinese District Magistrate. When the Viceroy of Canton ordered that foreigners should not assist foreigners in printing the Chinese language, Thoms has to work with Portuguese workmen at Macao to cut Chinese characters for the Dictionary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Reflecting on what had been achieved after a decade in China, Morrison and Milne recognised that without the support of the East India Company, progress on the Dictionary would likely have been much slower. While the Company’s support came ‘no doubt chiefly, if not solely, for commercial and literary purposes’ they suggested that this is no way lessened ‘the usefulness of the work, to those who wish to promote the knowledge of the Gospel in China’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> While Morrison’s work for the East India Company competed for his time with his work on translation, his association with the company provided significant financial resources, as well as connections with established Sinologists such as Sir George Staunton,  enabling his work to gain international recognition.</p>\n<p>In 1817 Morrison was awarded the Degree of Doctor of Divinity by the University of Glasgow, and in 1818 he was able to contribute £1000 towards the establishment of the Anglo-Chinese College at Malacca, to which he promised a further £100 a year for five years. The object of the college was ‘the cultivation of Chinese and European Literature, in order to the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ’, and with Milne appointed its first principal, it was clearly a missionary establishment.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Nevertheless, the College statutes did not exclude ‘any branch of human knowledge; nor any one of the circle of the sciences’ and the College Library was:</p>\n<p>to consist of European and Foreign Books, MSS., Maps. Charts, Drawings and Philosophical Apparatus; to which was to be attached a Museum of natural and artificial curiosities.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is noteworthy that this museum at Malacca followed the establishment of the Missionary Museum in London by only four years. While recent conflicts between creationism and Darwinism can seem emblematic of an anti-scientific attitude among contemporary evangelical Christians, this was not the case in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Science, and perhaps particularly Natural History, were regarded as an important part of the new knowledge that missionary educational establishments intended to communicate. Indeed, this may have been particularly the case in China, where an examination of Catholic missionary history suggested that it had been European scientific knowledge which made Matteo Ricci of greatest interest to the Chinese Emperor.</p>\n<p>Although Milne ultimately found that he had to pay the families of his Chinese students the equivalent to the wages they could earn by manual labour, the Anglo-Chinese College gradually built a reputation for academic excellence (it relocated to Hong Kong in 1843, where today Ying Wa College claims descent from the original College at Malacca).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 25 November 1819, Morrison wrote to the Missionary Society Directors in London somewhat triumphantly, telling them that at last the whole Bible had been translated into Chinese — Milne had worked on the Book of Job as well as the Historical Books of the Old Testament. Morrison acknowledged that the result was based on the Jesuit manuscript at the British Museum, and had imperfections, but understood his efforts in relation to a history of Bible translations into English:</p>\n<p>If Morrison and Milne’s Bible shall, in China, at some subsequent period, hold such a place in reference to a better translation, as Wickliff’s or Tyndale’s now hold in reference to our present English version, many will for ever bless God for the attempt; and neither the Missionary Society, nor the Bible Society, will ever regret the funds they have, or shall yet expend in aid of the object.</p>\n<p>It is not yet 500 years since Wickliff’s bones were dug up and burnt, chiefly because he translated the Scriptures; and it is not yet 300 years since Tyndall was strangled by the hands of the common hangman, and then burnt for the same cause….</p>\n<p>King James’s translators were fifty-four in number, and rendered into their mother tongue in their native country, under the patronage of their prince. Our version is the work of two persons, or at most of three (including the author of the MS).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>He was, of course, only thinking of the European translators and it is important to recognise the labours of the many Chinese who worked alongside both Morrison and Milne to undertake this work. It is significant that they appear in a number of images showing Morrison at work, suggesting a close partnership.</p>\n<p>Morrison hoped that ‘Moses, David, and the prophets; Jesus Christ and his apostles, using their own words’ would dispel ‘the gloomy darkness of pagan scepticism’ and that the ‘gilded idols of Budh, and the numberless images which fill the land, will one day assuredly fall to the ground, before the force of God’s word, as the idol Dagon fell before the ark’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In August 1820, Morrison’s wife returned to China after nearly six years away together with their children, but she sadly died less than a year later. In early 1822, Morrison arranged for his son and daughter to be sent back to Britain, but another tragedy followed when Milne died in the midst of revising the last two books of the Bible for printing.</p>\n<p>Morrison’s Dictionary was also nearing completion, with Part III printed in 1822. However, a major fire at Canton in November 1822 caused significant damage, including the destruction of ‘a hundred pounds worth of paper’ Morrison had intended to send to Malacca to print the Bible.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Reflecting on the anniversary of fifteen years in China, Morrison was frustrated that neither his dictionary nor Bible translation had yet been printed in full, but nevertheless took significant pride in the establishment of the Anglo-Chinese College, suggesting it had provoked the establishment of both the Serampore College and the Episcopal Mission College (Bishop’s College) in Calcutta (Kolkata).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In January 1823 Morrison travelled to Malacca where he visited the Anglo-Chinese College for the first time. The following month he went to the recently established East India Company settlement at Singapore, where he discussed relocating the college with Sir Stamford Raffles.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Back in London, Morrison’s long-term correspondent and supporter, Sir George Staunton, was in the process of setting up an Oriental Library and Museum, as part of the establishment of an Asiatic Society in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By November 1823, both the Bible and the Dictionary had been printed and it was proposed that the East India Company press be sent to the Anglo-Chinese College. By that time, the college had a library of 3380 volumes (2850 in Chinese), as well as scientific equipment that included an ‘electrical machine and battery’, perhaps brought to China by Morrison in 1807.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The museum contained Chinese drawings, maps and charts, as well as ‘Specimens of Chinese Court Beads, Musical Instruments, Sounding Vases used in Temples, Bronze Figures, Specimens of Weights and Measures, Specimens of Materia Medica of China’ as well as, somewhat intriguingly ’Specimens of the rocks in Palestine, Birds of Paradise, Cups of Bacchus, and Petrefactions’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>With his Dictionary and Bible translation printed, Morrison finally seems to have felt able to return home. He sailed in an East Indiaman, the <em>Waterloo,</em> in early December 1823, along with around 10,000 printed volumes in Chinese. Arriving in March the following year, he began a lengthy negotiation to avoid paying import duties on his library, which seems to have been taken up on his behalf by Staunton who also arranged for Morrison to present his Bible translation to King George IV on 15 April 1824.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The East India Company agreed to pay Morrison half his salary while in Britain, and he arranged to visit family in Newcastle before returning to London for the annual meetings of the London Missionary Society, the Bible Society and the Religious Tract Society in May, together with his son, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robert_Morrison\" target=\"_blank\">John Robert Morrison</a>. He then toured France, Ireland and Scotland, as well the major English towns, speaking at missionary meetings, as well as meeting European sinologists.</p>\n<p>When Morrison’s ‘Chinese Library and curiosities’ finally cleared customs in June 1824, they were transferred to the London Missionary Society headquarters, where a catalogue was prepared by his servant, A Sam.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Morrison attempted to negotiate with the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge to establish a professorship in Chinese language as a condition of the gift of his library, but was ultimately unsuccessful. As a result, in 1825, he attempted to establish a ‘Universal Language Institution’ in London, a collaboration between the London, Church, Baptist and Wesleyan Missionary Societies. Morrison offered a three-month course of lectures in Chinese to prospective missionaries while Rev. Henry Townley, having recently returned from Calcutta (Chapter 6), gave lectures in Bengali.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In January 1825, <em>Missionary Sketches</em> featured a ‘Bird’s eye view of the Anglo-Chinese College House at Malacca’, describing its history as well as hopes for its future in Singapore.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Morrison met with Raffles in Britain, hopeful of advancing plans for the Singapore Institution, but Raffles died in England during the summer of 1826, shortly after Morrison returned to China that May.</p>\n<p>Morrison’s library remained at the London Missionary Society until after Morrison died at Canton in 1834, shortly after the East India Company’s trading monopoly in China was abolished. In 1836, shortly after University College London received its royal charter,  it accepted Morrison’s library and appointed a Professor in Chinese.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This was to be Samuel Kidd, a former student of Bogue’s at Gosport Academy who had worked at the Anglo-Chinese College between 1824 and 1832, becoming its principal between 1828.</p>\n<p>In 1922, Morrison’s library was transferred on permanent loan to the newly established School of Oriental Studies, in some ways an updated version of the ‘Universal Language Institution’ Morrison attempted to establish a century earlier. The longer history of Morrison’s library is emblematic of a wider story, by which missionary and evangelical forms of knowledge and education became the basis for institutions, that have, in many cases, persisted into our own times. Morrison’s parallel work on his Chinese Dictionary alongside his Bible translation provides an insight into the ways in which Missionary knowledge itself,was sometimes built on commercial foundations.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Missionary Chronicle for August 1824, <em>Annual Meeting</em>, p.369: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n_EDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=missionary%20chronicle&amp;pg=PA369#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n_EDAAAAQAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;dq=missionary chronicle&amp;pg=PA369#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Evangelical Magazine for September 1794, To the Evangelical Dissenters who practice Infant Baptism, p.378: <a href=\"https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024450218?urlappend=%3Bseq=400%3Bownerid=13510798886842978-422\" target=\"_blank\">https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024450218?urlappend=%3Bseq=400%3Bownerid=13510798886842978-422</a> <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Christopher A.

Fuller during the mid-twentieth century, I was surprised to encounter a number of Australian artefacts – four spears and a club. Having briefly worked on a project in northern Australia in 2003, I knew missionaries played a significant part in Australian history, but associated this with other missionary societies and other places.</p>\n<p>The closest the London Missionary Society missions had got to Australia, or so I thought, were the islands of the Torres Strait, lying between Australia’s northeastern tip and Papua New Guinea. Having been sent a scan of Captain Fuller’s personal copy of the <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum,</em> published in the mid-nineteenth century, by the Bishop Museum in Hawai’i, I could see his pencil cross alongside the description for item no. 206, which provides the title for this chapter (he also wrote ‘LM Socy’ in pencil, directly onto the artefact in question – Field Museum accession number 272363 – image above).</p>\n<p>While the London Missionary Society’s longer-term history concentrated in Polynesia, Africa, Madagascar, India, China and the West Indies, its first three decades involved engagements in several other parts of the world. Richard Lovett’s (1899) <em>History of the London Missionary Society 1795-1895</em>, published to mark the Society’s first centenary, is structured around these six major ‘mission fields’, but also includes a chapter on ‘Missions Begun and Abandoned During the Century’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This includes brief accounts of missions to various parts of what is now Canada between 1799 and 1818, to French prisoners of war in 1801, to a brief mission in Buenos Aires in 1807, as well as to Malta and the Ionian Islands of Greece between 1808 and 1844 and Mauritius between 1814 and 1871.</p>\n<p>Listings of missionaries in the appendices of Lovett’s two volumes also include Joseph Frey, a missionary to the Jews in London between 1805 and 1809, and his China section includes an account of the mission to Mongolia between 1818 and 1840. Nowhere, however, does he refer to a mission to the Aboriginal people of Australia. How did such a quintessentially Australian artefact find its way into the collection of the museum of the London Missionary Society, along with a description that at least appears to include the artefact’s name in an indigenous Australian language?</p>\n<p>At least part of the answer has to do with Rev. Daniel Tyerman and George Bennet, the deputation sent by the Directors to tour the Society’s missions in May 1821. Having left them at Raiatea in late 1822, following their return from Hawai’i (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/principal-kinds-of-native-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 7</a>), we need to pick up their strand in the story. Spending time with the Raiatean king, Tamatoa III, they learned about Polynesian mythology as well as the historic significance of the ‘<em>maro’</em>, a hereditary robe of royalty covered with red feathers to which an additional section was added on the accession of each monarch.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Tyerman and Bennet’s account suggests it ‘might be regarded as an hieroglyphic tablet of the annals of Raiatea’, but noted it had been cast off by Tamatoa and sent ‘as another trophy of the gospel victories here to the Museum of the London Missionary Society’ by the resident missionaries John Williams and Lancelot Threlkeld.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> They visited Opoa, centre of the cult of Oro, and former residence of Tamatoa on Raiatea, describing it as the ‘metropolis of idolatry’, which by late 1822 was ‘flourishing in all the unpruned luxuriance of tropical vegetation’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Tyerman and Bennet’s described the efforts of the people of Raiatea and surrounding islands to establish a Christian way of life, including through the establishment of law courts that punished even those found guilty of being tattooed, consuming kava or leaving offerings for the deceased, at least initially. At the end of 1822 they witnessed the baptism of 150 people by John Williams and Lancelot Threlkeld, resident missionaries at Raiatea, and in early 1823 they visited the neighbouring island of Taha’a, where they attended the baptism of 198 people, as well as Borabora where they saw 90 more baptised. At Huahine they joined the annual Missionary meeting where a new code of laws was adopted, travelling to Tahiti in mid-May for the annual Missionary meeting, attended by ‘long lines of people… in their various picturesque dresses’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The meeting took place in a chapel so large it needed two preachers, where participants donated considerable amounts of coconut oil, arrow-root, cotton and pigs to support further missionary endeavours.</p>\n<p>Following the death of Pomare II in December 1821, a regency was established – Pomare’s son and heir apparent celebrated his third birthday when Tyerman and Bennet were at Tahiti in June 1823. They seem to have met with various senior men in their attempts to ensure the new Christian order would not fall victim to this seeming power vacuum. In September, when meeting a chief called Tati, they were presented with parts of the ‘bonnet and two tawdry covering which were cast over’ the idol of Oro, as well as a remnant of the ‘<em>maro’</em> used to invest Pomare II as king.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In October, Bennett acquired a <em>fare na atua</em> or god house ‘the only relic of the kind that we have seen in these islands; so utter was the demolition of such things even when the idols themselves were preserved for transportation to England as trophies of the triumph of the gospel’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> This example had evidently been hidden by priests in a cave in the mountains, and only recently ‘brought to market and sold’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At the end of October 1823 they went to Mo’orea for six weeks before travelling to Raivavae in the Austral Islands, where they visited newly constructed chapels and witnessed the baptism of 52 people, following which they were presented with a large quantity of bark cloth.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Visiting neighbouring Tubuai in early 1824, they saw more people baptised, despite the island suffering an epidemic disease and having only received Tahitian teachers 18 months earlier.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Returning to Rurutu, where they stopped on their way back from Hawai’i, they attended a church service at which 31 people were baptised. Arriving back at Mo’orea in mid-January and Tahiti in February, Tyerman and Bennet participated in the first Tahitian parliament to include representatives of the common people, convened to consider and adopt a new code of laws. Henry Nott, the Society’s senior missionary, had prepared the laws and presided over the meeting.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>While one of the forty articles adopted proposed to repeal the law against tattooing, ‘leaving it to persons to act as they pleased in respect to that custom’, a major point of debate arose over the establishment of a suitable punishment for murder.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> According to the summary given in Tyerman and Bennet’s account, while some suggested they should follow English precedent by adopting the death penalty, others pointed out that the death penalty was also applied in Britain for burglary and sheep stealing, which self-evidently went too far. Scriptural authority was cited, but Tati, a chief who ‘seemed a pillar of state’, pointed out that ‘many of the laws of the Old Testament had been thrown down by the Lord Jesus Christ’, and argued that the New Testament should be their guide.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Pati, the former chief priest of Oro at Mo’orea, who had been the first to burn his <em>to’o</em> (what the missionaries called ‘idols’), pointed out that for Christians, punishment should not be made for revenge but deterrence, suggesting that banishment to a remote island would be more effective in this regard (whether he had the British example of transportation to Australia in mind is unclear). Finally, a commoner argued that another reason for punishment was ‘to make the offender good again if possible’, noting that ‘if we kill a murderer, how can we make him better?’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>With new laws adopted, Tyerman and Bennet, together with the assembled missionaries, presided over the coronation of the infant king on 21 April 1824, the first Christian installation of its kind in Polynesia. The newly adopted code of laws was read to the assembled subjects by Henry Nott and presented to the boy king by George Bennet. Likewise, after he was anointed and crowned by Nott, Daniel Tyerman presented the new King with a Bible, telling him it was ‘the most valuable thing in the world.’ Sailing shortly afterwards to Mo’orea, Tyerman and Bennet prepared to leave for New South Wales in a small (50 ton) schooner, the Endeavour, together with one of the missionaries, Lancelot Threlkeld, who had ‘lately lost his excellent wife’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> On their way, they stopped at the Cook Islands, where they left Tahitian evangelists to continue the work of conversion, visiting a half-built chapel at Rarotonga (see <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>).</p>\n<p>After three years spent largely as guests of honour in the newly Christian kingdoms of Polynesia, established around an explicitly missionary religion, the Deputation’s subsequent visits must have been somewhat anticlimactic. On the way to Australia, the Endeavour stopped at Whangaroa Bay in the far North of New Zealand, where a Wesleyan mission had been established a year earlier. The ship’s deck quickly became crowded with Māori visitors, keen to trade, especially for muskets and gunpowder, New Zealand’s  ‘musket wars’ in the process of transforming Māori political relationships. It seems likely that some of the 34 Māori artefacts that the British Museum acquired from the London Missionary Society were acquired during trading undertaken at this time.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In the midst of these exchanges, the ship’s cook suddenly cried out that his cooking pans had been stolen, and someone else that the Captain’s trunk had been broken into.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>When Captain John Dibbs attempted to clear the deck, one of the visiting Māori dignitaries was knocked into the water. The women and children immediately left and the Māori men surrounded those Europeans on deck, including Bennet, Tyerman and Threlkeld, together with Threlkeld’s seven year old son. A man who had until then been trading with Bennet began to shout ’Tangata New Zealandi tangata kakino?’ (Is the New Zealand man a bad man?). Having learned some Tahitian, intelligible by New Zealand Māori, Bennet was able to reply ‘Kaore Kakino, tangata New Zealand, tangata kapai’ (Not bad, the New Zealander is a good man).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Despite being threatened with a large axe, brought for sharpening by the ship’s carpenter, Bennet attempted to demonstrate peaceful intentions by allowing himself to be cheated into buying the same fish repeatedly, for fish hooks taken in his jacket pocket.</p>\n<p>Eventually this tension broke when the ship’s boat returned, carrying William White from the Wesleyan mission at Kaeo, together with Te Ara, Principal Chief of Ngati Ura, who defused the situation. Te Ara had himself served on European ships, and his whipping on the Boyd as a crew member is understood to have led to a revenge attack that saw the entire crew killed in Whangaroa Bay, fifteen years earlier. Leaving Te Ara on board to ensure the ship’s safety, Tyerman and Bennet visited the mission station, hopeful that the transformations they had seen in Tahiti would soon come to New Zealand. This, however, was something to be overseen by the Wesleyans, as well as the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) who had established a mission at the Bay of Islands a decade earlier, under the oversight of the Rev. Samuel Marsden, Anglican Chaplain at New South Wales.</p>\n<p>The Endeavour entered Sydney Cove in New South Wales at midnight on 19 August 1824, a little over 54 years after her namesake, HMS Endeavour, arrived at Botany Bay under Captain James Cook. A penal colony had been established in 1788, after American independence meant convicted criminals could no longer be sent across the Atlantic. Free settlers followed in 1793, and by 1824 European settlement extended up to 100km from the harbour.</p>\n<p>Tyerman and Bennet were immediately struck by the stone and brick buildings of Sydney, as well as its two Anglican churches, two Methodist meeting houses, as well as Scotch and Roman Catholic chapels. They couldn’t help but notice the many convicts, however, ‘going about their occupations in jackets marked with the broad arrow, or some other badge of their servile condition. They are, for the most part, miserable creatures…’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Having spent three years with ‘no fear for our persons or our property, by day or night’ they became conscious of the need to ‘look well to ourselves and our locks for security’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Threlkeld would have items stolen on three occasions in the following nine months.</p>\n<p>On 24 August, Tyerman and Bennet visited the Rev. Samuel Marsden at his home in Parramatta (Chapter 4). Having come to Australia before the establishment of the Church Missionary Society  (CMS) in 1799, despite his involvement in directing the efforts of the CMS in New Zealand, Marsden remained a Director of the London Missionary Society and its appointed agent in New South Wales. Marsden introduced the visitors to Sir Thomas Brisbane, Governor of New South Wales since 1821.</p>\n<p>The Deputation visited the factory built nearby for female convicts, but by the end of the month their focus had shifted onto Australia’s indigenous people. Although told by Australian settlers (including Marsden) that earlier attempts to convert and civilise Aboriginal people had demonstrated it to be a hopeless endeavour, Tyerman and Bennet pointed out that the same sentiment had been expressed about the Khoesan peoples of South Africa forty years earlier, among whom there were now thousands of Christians (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a>):</p>\n<p>The Hottentot and Negro have proved themselves men, not only by exemplifying all the vices of our common nature, but by becoming partakers of all its virtues; and that the day of visitation will come to the black outcasts of New Holland also, we dare not doubt.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By 4 September, they were convinced that missionary work should be undertaken in Australia in the same way as it had been in the islands, preaching the gospel to people in their own language. While Aboriginal people had been able to pick up a few phrases in English ‘in mere common-place intercourse with Englishmen’:</p>\n<p>if we wait till they can hear and receive the words of eternal life in any other audible sound than their own, twenty generations may pass over this land of darkness and the shadow of death, before the true light shine upon it; or, which is more probable, the whole aboriginal stock may be extirminated (like the American Indians) by the progress of colonization.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although an Anglican school in the colony was in the process of teaching seven Aboriginal boys while a Methodist school taught seven girls, they asked:</p>\n<p>But what are these out of three millions? One Missionary, learning the language of one tribe, might be able to preach the simple truths of salvation to hundreds and thousands…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>No one, from what they could tell, had made any real effort to attempt to learn Australia’s Aboriginal languages.</p>\n<p>Over a dinner at Marsden’s house on 16 September, they sounded out Governor, Brisbane and the colony’s senior administrators, receiving a degree of support for ‘any prudent measure which might be adopted for ameliorating the condition of the aborigines’. ⁠24 They were told many tales about Aboriginal people, and Tyerman and Bennet’s lobbying efforts, encountered a great deal of resistance, noting that ‘many people who ought to know better are incurably convinced that the New Hollanders are incurably stupid’.⁠25</p>\n<p>They were even told that a prominent land owner at Bathurst had publicly declared that ‘the best use which could be made of “the black fellows” would be, to shoot them all, and manure the ground with their carcases’.⁠26</p>\n<p>For Tyerman and Bennet, opposition to missionary work among settlers must have been familiar and recognisable from other colonial settings, not least South Africa (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/mary-john-and-martha/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 2</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/the-giraffe/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3</a>). Such comparisons were also evidently apparent to others with experience across colonial worlds. At a Missionary Meeting of the Wesleyan Church in early October, the recently appointed solicitor-general of the colony, John Stephen, defended preachers in the West Indies ‘from the cruel calumnies of slave-holders and slave-drivers there’, having previously worked as an attorney in Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 18 October 1824, Tyerman and Bennet met with Governor Brisbane and recommended that Lancelot Threlkeld be appointed as missionary to the Aborigines at the new colony being formed at Moreton Bay on the Brisbane River (Threlkeld had originally planned to return to England to find a wife, but since arriving in New South Wales had met and arranged to marry Sarah Arndell, the daughter of Thomas Arndell, Assistant Surgeon with the first fleet). Tyerman and Bennet had recently met an Englishman who had been wrecked and lived at Moreton Bay, who told them the people were more numerous and ‘of a superior order, to the wretched vagrants here, who are degraded below their original wretchedness by their unhappy intercourse with Europeans’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> On his departure, after two years living among them, he had been given a fishing net and a basket by an old man, so that he could feed himself where he was going.</p>\n<p>The Governor seemed to think that in addition to being a missionary, Threlkeld might act as chaplain at the new settlement, but when told Threlkeld was not a Minister of the Church of England, his attitude seems to have cooled. No space was found for Threlkeld on the ships going to Moreton Bay,  and in December Saxe Bannister, the recently appointed Attorney General, told Threlkeld that they had ‘strong enemies behind the curtain’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 28 December, the anniversary of the arrival of the colony’s previous Governor, Macquarie, Tyerman, Bennet and Threlkeld attended the feast at Parramatta, arranged for the colony’s Aboriginal people, around 400 of whom attended. Some wore red ochre and white clay on their faces as well as necklaces of reed and kangaroo teeth. They were served roast beef and plum pudding, as well as bread and soup, washed down with half a pint of grog.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>With a mission at the new colony at Moreton Bay (Brisbane) ruled out, Tyerman and Bennet looked for an alternative location, settling on Reid’s Mistake, near Newcastle ‘where the natives were numerous and where the fishing tribes could obtain a plentiful supply of fish from Lake Macquarie’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> On 14 January 1825, they sailed around ten hours north from Sydney to see this location, returning four days later to ask the Governor for his approval. On 24 February 1825, Tyerman and Bennet arranged for their instructions to Threlkeld to be printed and circulated in New South Wales. This stated:</p>\n<p>As a knowledge of the language of the Natives must be regarded as essential to the success of your Mission, you will deem it your duty… to be using your best efforts to acquire it; while it will greatly facilitate the progress of your work, to make yourself familiar with their customs, superstitions and habits.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Land was set aside in trust for the mission, and in March Threlkeld returned to Newcastle together with his brother-in-law. After several days of rain, they walked to the place settlers called Reid’s Mistake and spoke with local Aboriginal people about their plans. Returning to Sydney, Threlkeld waited for the arrival of his three daughters from Tahiti, but when they did not arrive in April, returned to establish the new mission in May 1825.</p>\n<p>Threlkeld’s arrival seems to have been welcomed by the Aboriginal population, who invited him to a dance to celebrate.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>After nearly ten months in New South Wales, Tyerman and Bennet arranged to leave in June 1825, with the intention of going on the Society’s missions in Asia. Their stay had been much longer than anticipated, but they felt that ‘circumstances, which appears to be openings of Providence to direct our attention to the perishing and utterly neglected natives of this county, have detained us till this hour’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 21 May 1825, Threlkeld wrote in his journal about ‘a trusty native who speaks good English’. On 26 May the same man took him to a suitable location for the mission, a place name recorded by Threlkeld as ‘Bad debah’ (Bahtabah, now part of suburb of Belmont in the City of Lake Macquarie).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>This was the start of a relationship that laid the foundation for Thelkeld’s subsequent work in Australia. The man in question was known as M’Gill (possibly an anglicisation of Magal) and had spent some of his childhood at the military barracks at Sydney.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">36</a></sup> He may have worked at the penal colony at Port Macquarie, but had returned to the Newcastle area by the time Threlkeld arrived. It seems likely that M’Gill directed Threlkeld to establish the mission on land of which he was a traditional custodian.</p>\n<p>Life for Aboriginal people in New South Wales was extremely difficult in the early nineteenth century. Between the many male convicts, who preyed on Aboriginal women and girls, and the settlers, keen to exclude Aboriginal people from their grants of land, there were many dangers and very few legal protections. Magistrates were frequently the very same settlers with whom they were in conflict. Having worked as a ‘bush constable’, M’Gill was no stranger to the violence of the young colony and he seems to have deliberately cultivated Threlkeld as an advocate for his people, while teaching him his language.</p>\n<p>When Threlkeld witnessed an Aboriginal burial shortly after his arrival, he was asked not to tell anyone the location of the grave, since they feared a white fellow would come and take the deceased woman’s head away. Threlkeld connected this to the Maori heads he had seen for sale in Sydney, part of the trade for guns and powder during ‘the musket wars’, but was soon to learn that there was also a trade in Aboriginal heads operating in New South Wales. By spending much of each day in conversation with M’Gill, who he referred to in later years as his Tutor, Threlkeld heard stories and rumours of the deadly violence unfolding across the colony. It was not long before Threlkeld witnessed violent acts himself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>In December 1825, Threlkeld was alerted to the sound of an Englishman beating an Aboriginal man, who had tried to stop him abducting his ten year old daughter. When Threlkeld tried to report the assault, his concerns were essentially dismissed by the magistrates. When asked by Saxe Bannister at around the same time about rumours of Aboriginal violence in Hunter River, Threlkeld could only say that he was surprised that ‘more Whites are not speared than there are considering the gross provocation given’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>During the first half of 1826, M’Gill left Threlkeld for several weeks. He went into the mountains to participate in a ceremony, taking with him around 60 spears that he intended to exchange for possum skin cord. According to Threlkeld, he attended a ceremony at around this time ‘which has initiated him into all the rights of an Aborigine’. Despite spending some of his early life among the settlers, M’Gill was in the process of acquiring the authority to act as a leader among his people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>At the end of September 1826, Threlkeld and his family moved to the house that had been built for them at the place he now wrote as ‘Ba-ta-ba’, having briefly also written ‘Biddobar’. In April 1827 he arranged for the printing at Sydney of <em>Specimens of A Dialect of the Aborigines of New South Wales; being the first attempt to form their speech into a written language</em>. Threlkeld signs the Preface from ‘Bah-tah-bah’, and the text bears the fingerprints of M’Gill, now increasingly known as Biraban (which appears in the text as Berabahn, translated as Eagle hawk).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>By this time, Threlkeld was engaged in a difficult and protracted correspondence with the Directors  of the Missionary Society in London, who had become alarmed at the extremely high costs of establishing this new mission in New South Wales – around £500 a year including clothes, tea, sugar, tobacco and fish hooks paid to Aboriginal people to work at the mission. Thelkeld found that without such inducements they were unlikely to stick around for long, given the lure of nearby Newcastle – evidently a source of plentiful alcohol.</p>\n<p>The Directors suggested that unless the New South Wales government funded some of these expenses, as originally anticipated, Threlkeld should return to the Islands. When his bills were not paid by the Society’s Secretary in London, Threlkeld was arrested at Sydney in November 1827. Concerned at characterisations of his mission as extravagant and ultimately hopeless, Threlkeld attempted to appeal to British History, arguing in a circular he had printed in 1828, that:</p>\n<p>It may be said, with truth, respecting the Aborigines of this land, – treat them as savages, and they will act as savages; – treat them as Men, and they will act as men. We view the conduct of Charactacus, leading the Aboriginal Britons and opposing the invading Romans with applause, and Boadicea, queen of an Aboriginal tribe, with her eighty thousand English slaughtered by insulting conquerors with sympathy. But the Aborigines of Australia, who have no combined numbers, no political power, to render themselves respected, or rather feared, by the invaders of their country, are driven, indirectly, from their districts, as other wild beasts of the deserts, without Sympathy, when the civilized hand cultivates their soil!<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Although Thelkeld continued his language work while attempting to defend his expenditure, he was informed by a letter he received in December 1828 that the LMS Directors had decided to abandon the mission. They even subsequently instructed Samuel Marsden to place an advertisement in the Sydney Gazette, which declared that the London Missionary Society was discontinuing the Mission at Lake Macquarie, as well as their connection with Threlkeld. Ultimately, the new Governor of the colony, Darling, agreed to support Threlkeld’s mission, although it was relocated to land Threlkeld was granted in a personal capacity on the other side of Lake Macquarie. It became known as the Ebenezer Mission and continued until 1841.</p>\n<p>Was the club, now at the Field Museum in Chicago, collected by Threlkeld during the short years the London Missionary Society supported his mission at Bahtabah? Threlkeld had been actively involved in collecting for the Missionary Museum in the Society Islands, so it is likely he would have continued collecting things in New South Wales. Much later, in 1851, he even took an active part in organising a missionary exhibition in Sydney.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> The ‘Tur Rursna’ does not appear in the earliest surviving <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum</em>, but given the long journey between London and New South Wales, it could have arrived soon after the catalogue was published in 1826.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, was it collected by Daniel Tyerman or George Bennet and given to the Missionary Museum together with other items they collected during their deputation? George Bennet returned to Britain in 1829 (Tyerman died in Madagascar in July 1828) and is known to have given a spear thrower, club and shield from coastal New South Wales to the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society (established 1822) as well as a’ Wooden Instrument used by the Aborigines of New Holland, to assist in throwing their Spears’ to the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society (established 1820).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Might the club have been collected by Tyerman and Bennet, and only subsequently connected with the term ‘Tur Rursna’?</p>\n<p>It is hard to be sure of the ultimate origin of the club, but the inclusion of the Aboriginal term <em>Tur Rursna</em> in the later version of the catalogue, published around 1860, remains the best clue we have. The Cuming family collection, assembled in London from 1806 onwards, includes a boomerang acquired around 1840 with an attached label that reads:</p>\n<p>TUR-RUR-MA called by Europeans Boomerang. When thrown into the air, it revolves on its centre and returns, forming a circle in orbit from and to the thrower.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>The term ’tur-rur-ma’ had, by then, featured in a list of common nouns given in <em>An Australian Grammar,</em> published by Lancelot Threlkeld at Sydney in 1834. There it was described as:</p>\n<p>An instrument of war, called by Europeans Boomering, of a half moon shape, which when thrown in the air, revolves on its own centre, and returns forming a circle in its Orbit from and to the thrower, to effect which it is thrown against the wind; but, in war it is thrown against the ground which it strikes in its revolution and rebounds apparently with double violence, and strikes at random some distant object, and wounds severely with its sharpened extremities.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Given the closeness of these texts, it seems likely that the information written on the Cuming boomerang came from Threlkeld’s <em>Grammar</em>. Interestingly, a list of names of common places in the same text  includes ‘But-ta-ba’ with the meaning given as ‘The name of a hill on the margin of the lake’. Threlkeld’s introduction to the <em>Grammar</em> makes the case for the kind of detailed linguistic work he was doing with Biraban, partly by including a list of what he calls ‘Barbarisms’ – words pretending to be of Aboriginal origin, but which have likely arisen out of misunderstanding:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Barbarism</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Meaning</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Aboriginal proper word</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Boomiring</td>\n<td>A weapon</td>\n<td>Tur-ra-ma. A half moon like implement used in war.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Waddy</td>\n<td>A cudgel</td>\n<td>Ko-tit-ra</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Woomerrer</td>\n<td>A weapon</td>\n<td>Ya-kir-ri. Used to throw the spear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kangaroo</td>\n<td>An animal</td>\n<td>Ka-rai. Various names</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>While whoever wrote the label for the Cuming Museum had almost certainly seen Threlkeld’s <em>Australian Grammar</em>, this doesn’t necessarily mean it was unrelated to items in the Missionary Museum. In 1839, Henry Syer Cuming wrote to the LMS Directors complaining about the miserable state of the Missionary Museum, offering his services to help in arranging the museum and identifying the localities from which items came if they would remunerate him for his services.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Did he acquire a boomerang for his personal collection in return for his curatorial services, and was it through consulting the Society’s library, containing linguistic works by their former missionary Threlkeld, that he discovered the term <em>Tur-rur-ma</em>?</p>\n<p>It might seem unlikely that Threlkeld would have sent his publications to London given the circumstances in which he was so acrimoniously and publicly dismissed. However, in 1830, William Ellis, who originally left England for the Pacific with Threlkeld in 1816, was appointed Assistant Foreign Secretary of the Missionary Society in London, and in 1832 became its Chief Foreign Secretary (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/13-all-wrapped-up-in-a-piece-of-tahitian-cloth/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 13</a>).</p>\n<p>Despite having fallen out with the Society’s Directors, Threlkeld appears to have remained on friendly terms with Ellis, asking him to show the Missionary Museum to several friends visiting London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> In 1838, having recently been involved in establishing an Auxiliary society to raise funds for the Society in Australia, Threlkeld suggested that William Westbrooke Burton, a judge at the Supreme Court of New South Wales returning to London on leave, visit the Missionary Museum, where:</p>\n<p>My former colleague the Revd Willm Ellis the Foreign Secretary to the Society will feel much pleasure in giving explanations respecting the many curious articles to be seen at the Society’s Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>On 23 May 1840, Threlkeld wrote to Ellis from Ebenezer on Lake Macquarie, suggesting that he was making up ‘a packet for the Directors &amp;c &amp;c which I hope to get conveyed by some Captain to the Rooms’. Did this packet include Aboriginal weapons, or did it just include his texts on Aboriginal languages, printed at Sydney?</p>\n<p>At the end of the <em>Annual Report of the Mission to Aborigines, Lake Macquarie</em> for the year 1839, Threlkeld offers a comparison of the dialects spoken by Aboriginal people, which suggests that ‘Tur-rur-ma’ may have been quite a localised term, with even people living inland from Newcastle at Manilla River using a different term:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Lake Macquarie Inlet</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Manilla River</strong></th>\n<th><strong>*Swan River</strong></th>\n<th><strong>*King George’s Sound</strong></th>\n<th><strong>English</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tur-rur-ma</td>\n<td>Pa-run</td>\n<td>Koilee</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>The Boomerang</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>* Dialects taken from a recent work entitled “Australia, an appeal to the World on behalf of the younger branches of the family of Shem.”</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In 1854-55, Threlkeld, then Minister of the Mariner’s Church at Sydney, published a series of ‘Reminiscences’ in <em>The Christian Herald.</em> One, published on 31 March 1855, went under the title <em>Warlike Implements, the Tur-rur-ma, or Boomerang.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Commenting on the biblical prophecy that ‘The nations shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks’,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup> Threlkeld pointed out that the indigenous people of New South Wales formerly had no metal weapons. The text then describes:</p>\n<p>an instrument of warfare called <em>Yir-ra</em>, in reality, a very simple wooden sword. At first when I saw one, I mistook it for a Boommerang, the shape in the blade being very much like that weapon. There was, however this difference, the Boommerang is alike at both ends, the wooden sword has a handle at one end with a bend contrary to the blade.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Threlkeld draws attention to an image recently published in Joseph Bonomi’s (1852) <em>Nineveh and its Palaces (Figure 42)</em>. This he states:</p>\n<p>is not the <em>Australian</em> Bommereng, but the Australian <em>wooden sword.</em> The difference of shape appears to be only an accidental circumstance arising from the natural growth of the tree whence the wooden sword is taken.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fnNaN\" id=\"fnrefNaN\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">NaN</a></sup></p>\n<p>Threlkeld comments on the term ‘Boomerrang’, suggesting ‘The Orthography of this barbarism, for it is not an aboriginal term, but like many others, is a pure invention palmed upon the Blacks, as belonging to their classic lore’. Instead, Thelkeld suggests that ‘the proper aboriginal name’ is <em>Tur-rur-ma,</em> a term he almost certainly learned from Biraban.</p>\n<p>It seems likely that <em>Tur Rursna</em> as it appears in the catalogue of the Missionary Museum is either a misreading of ‘Tur-rur-ma’, written onto a label, or else is one of Threlkeld’s earlier attempts at transcription – like the many different ways in which he wrote the place name Bahtabah.</p>\n<p>Threlkeld’s <em>Reminiscences</em> suggest that the club now at Chicago’s Field Museum is not in fact a <em>Tur-rur-ma</em>, since it clearly has a handle at one end. Neither does it appear to be a <em>Yir-ra</em>, or wooden sword, since its angular profile is unlike the image he identifies as one, nor is it like other early examples recently identified in British museum collections.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fnref53\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">53</a></sup> While we may never definitively know the ultimate origins of this artefact, we can be fairly certain that these words, translations from a living and spoken Aboriginal language into a written form, arose from the friendship Biraban established with Threlkeld on 21 May 1825.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>I am extremely grateful to Gaye Sculthorpe for pointing out that the club is not what Threlkeld called a ‘Yir-ra’, based on her recent work, for providing information on Bennet’s gifts of Australian items to the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society, as well as for connecting me with Daniel Simpson and Eleanor Foster who were working on related areas. I am extremely grateful to Danny for pointing out the use of ‘Tur-rur-ma’ in relation to the Cuming Museum boomerang, now at Saffron Walden, as well as within Threlkeld’s linguistic work. I am grateful to Eleanor for sharing her dissertation, and for her generous acknowledgement of my prior work on this club.</p>\n<p>In the more distant past, I spent the best part of 2003 in Australia, where I learnt a great deal about Australian Aboriginal life from Nicolas Peterson, as well as Howard Morphy at the ANU. It was during that time that I first came across Niel Gunson’s compilation of material on Threlkeld. This chapter is a somewhat late return-prestation, acknowledging the impact that the time I spent in Australia has had on my subsequent work.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Lovett, R. 1899. <em>The History of the London Missionary Society, 1795-1895.</em> Henry Frowde, Volume II.

This conflict underpinned the northern European Reformation of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which Protestantism took shape, and seems to have conditioned the way that LMS missionaries responded to religious ‘idols’, whenever and wherever they were encountered.</p>\n<p>Writing about missionary encounters in the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia, Webb Keane has described this conflict in terms of a clash of semiotic ideologies, suggesting that Protestantism developed a moral narrative of modernity, by which people were understood to be progressively emancipated through their detachment from material forms – a narrative that shaped notions of ‘fetishism’ later in the nineteenth century and arguably continues to underpin contemporary imaginings of secular modernity.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>In many ways it is The Virgin Mary and Child, among all the artefacts listed in the 1826 catalogue, that allows us to unpack the fundamental problem that the London Missionary Society had with ‘idols’ – objects that formed a focus for acts of religious worship – and the reasons these became a dominant focus for missionary collecting during the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>\n<p>Following the re-opening of the Missionary Museum at Austin Friars in August 1824, the considerable costs of ‘building the museum’ (£417) generated concern within the Society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> Should funds raised to support overseas missionary work be used to enable the preservation and display of artefacts in London? Writing from Raiatea in the Pacific on 20 November 1823, the missionaries Lancelot Threlkeld (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/10-two-of-the-tur-rursna/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 10</a>) and John Williams (<a href=\"https://argonauts2022.net/12-a-gigantic-idol/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 12</a>) declared as part of their appeal for a missionary ship:</p>\n<p>Did you know the state of the surrounding islands, how ripe they are for the reception of the gospel, you would sell the very gods out of your Museum, if it were necessary to afford the means of carrying the glad tidings of salvation to those now sitting in darkness.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>A catalogue of the museum’s contents was compiled and printed, sales of which were intended to ‘to diminish the expense incurred by the preparation and support of the Museum’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> The catalogue’s price was not fixed, but left to the ‘liberality’ of museum visitors, with a donations box located in the museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> By May 1825, the Missionary Chronicle reported that this had returned 57 pounds 7shillings and 5 pence.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup></p>\n<p>Sadly, there are no known copies of this original 1824 catalogue, but the British Library retains a copy of the slightly later 1826 version.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> This makes it possible to gain a sense of how the collections had grown in the twelve years since John Campbell returned to Britain from South Africa with his giraffe (Chapter 3), as well as many other things, initiating the establishment of the Missionary Museum.</p>\n<p>The title page of the catalogue provides a guide to what may be found in the museum, listing three main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Specimens in Natural History</li>\n<li>Various Idols of Heathen Nations</li>\n<li>Dresses, Manufactures, Domestic Utensils, Instruments of War, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is followed by an “Advertisement” providing more background on the museum and its collection, explaining that the articles composing the museum were supplied chiefly by Missionaries of the London Missionary Society, with a few others being donations from ‘benevolent travellers, or friendly officers of mercantile vessels’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> It then explains the three categories of material set out on the previous page, suggesting that:</p>\n<p>The Missionaries rightly judged that the natural productions of the distant countries in which they reside would be acceptable at home, especially to the juvenile friends, and to others who may not have opportunity of viewing larger Collections.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>Natural History, although it formed a significant dimension of John Campbells’ original collections, are effectively dismissed as curiosities chiefly of interest to children. It then goes on:</p>\n<p>The efforts also of natural genius, especially in countries rude and uncivilised, afford another class of interesting curiosities; whilst they prove how capable even the most uncivilised of mankind are of receiving that instruction which it is the study of Missionaries to communicate.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>The ‘Dresses, Manufactures, Domestic Utensils and Instruments of War, &amp;c. &amp;C. &amp;c.’, through examples such as finely worked samples of bark cloth brought by William Ellis from Hawaii (Chapter 7), essentially demonstrate potential – a capacity for conversion, but also to be schooled in civilisation – though this argument seems to have concentrated on ‘countries rude and uncivilised’ – which in this context seems to have referred largely to Africa and the Pacific.</p>\n<p>Presumably penned by a professional preacher, the Advertisement altered the order outlined on the title page so that the third category to be described delivers the rhetorical hammer blow in a new paragraph:</p>\n<p>But the most valuable and impressive objects in this Collection are the numerous, and (in some instances) <em>horrible</em> IDOLS_,_ which have been imported from the South Seas Islands, from India, China, and Africa; and among these, those especially which were actually given up by their former worshippers, from <em>a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry</em> – a conviction derived from the ministry of the Gospel by the Missionaries.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup></p>\n<p>Value here is accorded to ‘Idols’ over and above either Natural History or ‘efforts of natural genius’, but special emphasis is given to those given up by their former worshippers, especially when this came from <em>‘a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry’.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>For Protestant evangelicals, the removal of any ‘idols’ may have seemed a good in and of itself, but real value was connected to objects which demonstrated the purpose of the Missionary Society, as set out in its founding constitution of 1795 (Chapter 1):</p>\n<p>The sole object is to spread the knowledge of Christ among the heathen and other unenlightened nations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup></p>\n<p>In this light, ‘idols’ sent to the Missionary Museum by converted ‘heathen’ on the basis of conviction and a change of heart – indicators of sincere conversion – were by far the most valuable and impressive objects in the collection_._</p>\n<p>The <em>Advertisement</em> explicitly connects the display of these ‘singularly interesting objects’ to Pomare’s despatch of his ‘idol gods’ from Tahiti to London in 1816 (Chapter 4), quoting Pomare’s suggestion that missionaries ‘send them to Britain, that the English people might see what foolish gods they had been accustomed to adore’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> In displaying these in their Museum, the Directors of the Society were doing no more than complying with Pomare’s wishes.</p>\n<p>The final paragraph of the <em>Advertisement</em> expresses a desire that these “trophies of Christianity” will:</p>\n<p>inspire the spectators with gratitude to God for his goodness to our native land, in favouring us so abundantly with the means of grace, and the knowledge of his salvation and at the same time, with thankfulness that these blessings have, in some happy degree, been communicated, and by our means, to the distant isles of the Southern Ocean.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup></p>\n<p>The means of grace received in the British Isles by ancestors, generations previously, was connected, as it had been at the foundation of the Society in 1795 (Chapter 1), to the forward extension and communication of these blessings to other parts of the world. The final sentence of the <em>Advertisement</em>, presumably originally written in 1824 suggested:</p>\n<p>Many of the curious articles in the Collection are calculated to excite in the pious mind, feelings of deep commiseration for the hundreds of million of the human race, still the vassals of ignorance and superstition; whilst the success with which God has already crowned our labours, should act as a powerful stimulus to efforts, far more zealous than ever, for the conversion of the heathen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>Keane’s moral narrative of modernity is briefly set out here in grand historical terms for an assumed audience of British Christians – ‘our’ ancestors were vassals of ignorance and superstition but by the grace of God ‘we’ have reached a state of liberation that creates an obligation to liberate others still bound by these same chains.</p>\n<p>A listing of individual items forms the body of the catalogue which follows, but on the final page of the catalogue an appeal for ‘Annual Subscriptions, or Donations, in aid of the Funds of this Society’ is followed by the ‘<em>Form of a Bequest’</em>. This included a blank space for an amount to be entered, allowing visitors whose missionary zeal had been inspired by their visit to the museum provide a legacy for the Society.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1826, the Missionary Museum was in the process of being reimagined as an extension of the fundraising work that underpinned all aspects of the London Missionary Society’s operations. The title page and <em>Advertisement</em> establishing a framework through which visitors would be expected to engage with the museum and its collections, categorising and valuing the materials on display, but also providing a narrative in which the visitor – assumed to be not only British, but also Protestant and most likely evangelical, or at least sympathetic – could play a part.</p>\n<p>Prefiguring the secularised narratives of progress that would shape the museums and displays of the later nineteenth century, in relation to what Tony Bennett has called ‘the exhibitionary complex’, this script of liberating Grace has parts for missionaries, supporters, converts as well as idols.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup> But how well do the artefacts listed on the pages of the catalogue play their allotted parts?</p>\n<p>Individual scenes, including Campbell’s giraffe (Chapter 3), Pomare’s idols (Chapter 4) and Ellis’ Hawaiian bark cloth (Chapter 7) appear to conform to these categories, but taken as a whole, how far do the listings of the 1826 catalogue reflect the <em>Advertisment’s</em> exposition?</p>\n<p>Considered in numerical terms, both ‘specimens in Natural History’ (117 listings) and ‘efforts of natural genius’ (323 listings) outnumbered ‘Idols’ (110 listings) among the 550 artefacts listed in the catalogue. Geographically, the largest number came from Africa (163 listings), with twice as many ‘efforts of natural genius’ (111 listings) as ‘specimens in Natural History’ (52 listings), but no ‘Idols’. Next came the Pacific (135 listings), with a good number of ‘Idols’ (45 listings), but still more ‘efforts of natural genius’ (89 listings). This is followed by China (87 listings), with a third as many ‘Idols’ (19 listings) as ‘efforts of natural genius’ (60 listings), although this figure includes quite a number of books (17 listings), such as the Chinese dictionary of Robert Morrison (Chapter 9).</p>\n<p>Other geographical areas, such as Australia (Chapter 10), Madagascar (Chapter 19) and the Americas include far smaller numbers of items (107 combined total listings), but these don’t include any items that can be categorised as ‘Idols’, apart from possibly the PEHI rattle from Demerara (Chapter 5).</p>\n<p>Only among artefacts listed as coming from the ‘East Indies’ (58 listings in total) is there a clear predominance of ‘Idols’ (45 listings). Indeed, the number  of ‘Idols’ is the same as from the Pacific (45 listings), with much smaller numbers of ‘specimens in Natural History’ (6 listings) and ‘efforts of natural genius’ (7 listings). But how far do these ‘Indian idols’ represent what the ADVERTISEMENT called ’valuable and impressive objects… actually given up by their former worshippers, from a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry’?</p>\n<p>Twenty-one of the forty-five ‘Idols’ listed were ‘models’, most likely commissioned by Henry Townley in Calcutta (Chapter 6). Following these in the catalogue is, intriguingly, is a listing for:</p>\n<p>A Case of REJECTED IDOLS from Cuddapah, in the East Indies.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup></p>\n<p>John Hands began preaching and establishing schools at Cuddapah (Kadapa) in 1822, and a mission was established there by William Howell in 1824.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> It seems likely that these items were sent to London when a small number of people were baptised, according to an account published later in the century (1858) ‘from doubtful motives’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n<p>After this, the catalogue includes a fairly large number of items from Rangoon (Yangon – 19 listings), including thirteen Buddhas, two figures of Krishna, a figure of Kali standing on the stomach of Shiva, a stone lingam, and a set of bells from one of the temples. Beginning a listing for the ‘Fourth Shelf’ was a gilt Buddha from Rangoon, described as ‘a Sea Port in the Burmese Empire’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup> This was followed by a long text describing Buddha as an avatar of Vishu, taken from a Sanskrit inscription at Bodh Gaya, translated by Charles Wilkins, which appeared in the first volume of <em>Asiatick Researches, published at Calcutta by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1788.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup></p>\n<p>A very brief mission had been established at Rangoon in 1810, but within months one of the missionaries, J.C. Brain, had died and the other Edward Pritchett returned to Madras. Given how short this unsuccessful mission was, it seems extremely unlikely that all these items could have been collected at that time, especially as it predated the establishment of the Missionary Museum.</p>\n<p>Rather, a hint at the likely source of these items comes from a list of thanks, published in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> of August 1826, stating:</p>\n<p>Also, to Mr. Heritage and others of the Society’s Friends, connected with the Congregation at Union Chapel, Calcutta; for several Burmese Idols (some of which were formerly in the large Pagoda at Rangoon), and other valuable curiosities for the Society’s Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup></p>\n<p>Mr Heritage appears to have been a fairly long-term resident of Calcutta, described in 1832 as the Commander of the Hon. Company’s pilot schooner “Henry Meriton”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup> This normally guided vessels on the Hooghly River, between the sea and Calcutta, making Mr Heritage what the <em>Advertisement</em> described as a ‘friendly officer’ of a mercantile vessel. In May 1824, however, this pilot schooner had been equipped with a pair of canons and joined the hastily assembled fleet to transport troops, together with their howitzers, to Rangoon (Yangon) as part of the first Anglo-Burmese war.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup></p>\n<p>The famous golden Shwegadon Pagoda became the military headquarters of the invading troops, who comprehensively pillaged it. It seems likely, therefore that ‘Mr. Heritage and others of the Society’s Friends’ acquired these ‘Burmese Idols’ either as a direct result of their participation in the invasion of Rangoon, or from soldiers returning from the conflict with loot.</p>\n<p>The forced removal of these items as part of military action is not made explicit in the  Missionary Museum catalogue, although the degree to which this implicit provenance would have been understood by those reading the catalogue in the years immediately after the war is unclear. From our perspective, the discrepancy between the display of these items and the ninth commandment – <em>Thou shalt not steal</em> – is striking, but perhaps this was felt to be balanced by the second and third commandments – <em>Thou shalt have no other gods before me</em> and <em>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image</em>.</p>\n<p>After the list of items taken from Rangoon, a short note in the catalogue suggests that:</p>\n<p>In the front of the larger idols are several smaller ones, of silver, brass, copper, and stone: also a curious censer, of spoon for incense.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">29</a></sup></p>\n<p>These likely relate to an early arrival at the museum – back in April 1816 the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> announced that Mr Hands had sent the Directors ‘a number of idols of silver, copper, &amp;c. for their Museum. Also a copy of St. Luke’s gospel, written in leaves: Christ’s Sermon on the Mount, in the Canara language, &amp;c.’ from Bellary [Ballari].<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">30</a></sup></p>\n<p>John Hands began work there in 1810, where he set about translating the Bible into Canarese, so it seems likely the gospel was one on which he had worked. The first convert was only recorded in 1819, however, and the letter he sent with the items in September 1815 explained that ‘he cannot gratify them with an account of the poor Hindus around him having openly embraced the gospel’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup></p>\n<p>With the possible exception of the ‘REJECTED IDOLS from Cuddapah’, neither the idols from Ballary, the looted material from Rangoon, nor the models from Calcutta were given up voluntarily by converts to Christianity. Nevertheless, the catalogue rounded off its listing of Indian ‘Idols’ by reprinting the text which had appeared in <em>Missionary Sketches</em> in 1819, following the descriptions of Townley’s ‘models’  citing Psalm cxv. 5-10: ‘These are specimens, Christian Reader, of the gods of the heathen in India worshipped by more than a hundred millions of deluded people. These are the creatures of a corrupt imagination, and the workmanship of men’s hands…’.</p>\n<p>Following this, a paragraph from Ward’s <em>Account of the Writings, Religion, and Manners of the Hindoos including Translations from their Principal Works</em> was printed in the catalogue:</p>\n<p>Nine-tenths of the whole Hindu population pay no conscientious regard whatever to the forms of their religion, and yet the various cruelties accompanying their superstitions occasion the death of more than ten thousand persons every year. And notwithstanding the veneration in which some pretend to hold their gods, yet many, especially the poor, take the liberty of abusing them. When it thunders awfully, respectable Hindoos say, “Oh! the gods are giving us a bad day;” the lower orders say, “The rascally gods are dying.” During a heavy rain, a woman of respectable class frequently says, “Let the gods perish! my clothes are all wet.” A man of low castes says, “These rascally gods are sending more rain.” Ward. vol.1 p.xc</p>\n<p>Red shows ‘Idols’, dominating the Indian collections in particular, Blue shows ‘Natural History’ while ‘Green’ shows everything else (efforts of natural genius)</p>\n<p>Here Green shows ‘Natural History’ and Red shows ‘Idols’ but other colours are allocated to the other categories listed on the Catalogue’s title page (Dresses, Manufactures &amp; Domestic Utensils, Instruments of War), while an additional category has been added for ‘Publications’, which demonstrates how significant these were as part of the collection from China.</p>\n<p>Two lines, one thick, mark an ending of sorts for the ‘EAST INDIES’ section of the <em>Catalogue of the Missionary Museum</em>, but in the remaining space of the page follows the description with which this chapter began:</p>\n<p>THE VIRGIN MARY AND CHILD, from Mysore, that belonged to two Native Roman Catholics, who embraced the Christian religion, and sent the same to the Missionary Society</p>\n<p>Beneath this a further paragraph appears in quotation marks:</p>\n<p>“The people were in great consternation at the removal of the image, and offered large sums of money for it; one offered twenty pagodas, another his daughter, and another even declared he would sell his own child and procure money enough to purchase it, if it might be retained; but a deaf ear was turned to the proposals, being aware of the danger of making it an object of worship, and felt as the disciples of Christ,- constrained to take it away.” <em>Vide Missionary Chronicle for January 1826</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">32</a></sup></p>\n<p>Given that the publication referred to appeared in the same year as the <em>Catalogue</em> was printed, I initially wondered whether the inclusion of this text after the thick black line suggested an addition to an already prepared printing block. However, given that the items from Rangoon were reported even later in the same year (August), but were incorporated into the main section of the East Indies section, I now think that the lines serve to deliberately demarcate a Christian ‘idol’ from the ‘heathen’ idols that preceded it.</p>\n<p>The paragraph in quotes comes from a printed version of a letter, originally sent to the Society’s secretary on 23 July 1825 and signed by the London Missionary Society’s three European missionaries at Bangalore, Hiram Chambers, William Campbell and Stephen Laidler. It explained:</p>\n<p>We are permitted at this time to lay before you, two trophies of the victorious power of divine truth over the delusions of the Antichrist; trophies which we hope and trust may prove powerful auxiliaries in making known Christ and Him crucified, to their perishing fellow-men.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fnref33\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">33</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Antichrist was not a gruesome Heathen deity, but rather the Catholic Church, and the two ‘trophies’ were not ‘idols’, but rather two young men who had converted to Protestant Christianity and who, it was hoped, would play a part in converting others. Christianity’s roots in south India are believed to go back to the arrival of St Thomas the apostle in the first century, but the roots of Catholicism in Mysore are generally traced to the establishment of a Mysore mission by Father Leonardo Cinnami in 1649.</p>\n<p>Following a visit to Bangalore (Bengaluru) by John Hands, from his mission station at Bellary (Ballard), 300km away, Stephen Laidler had established a mission there for the LMS in 1820. With access to the Indian town prohibited to European missionaries by the Rajah of Mysore, preaching was initially directed at the Europeans and Sepoys in the military cantonment. This seems to have changed, however, after the arrival at the mission of Samuel Flavel, who actively preached in surrounding villages, distributing tracts and copies of the gospels in local languages.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fnref34\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">34</a></sup></p>\n<p>Born at Quilon (Kollam) on the Malabar Coast of Kerala in 1787, Shunkurulingam, as he was known before he was baptised, was employed by a British officer at a fairly young age. He travelled widely in India, visiting Mauritius before being employed in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) as a butler. He came across a translation of the Gospels into Tamil which initiated a personal quest to know more about Protestant Christianity. This led to his baptism at Tellicherry (Thalassery) by an East India Company chaplain, when he adopted the name Samuel. Invited by Laidler to join the new mission at Bangalore, Samuel became central to its work. He was ordained as the pastor of the native church in 1822, when he adopted the surname Flavel at Laidler’s suggestion. John Flavel, like his Indian namesake, had been a learned Puritan minister, famous for preaching in the face of official prohibition.</p>\n<p>The letter, written at Bangalore in July 1825, and printed in the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> in January 1826, concerns an event that took place in the city of Mysore (Mysuru), with none of the three European missionaries present. Samuel Flavel had made the journey of nearly 150km at the invitation of two brothers who were catechists at the city’s Roman Catholic Church.</p>\n<p>Five years previously they had talked with Joshua, an Indian convert connected to the London Missionary Society, which led them to question Catholic practice. The elder of the two was, according to the account given, flogged by the priest for his impertinence – an example of what the letter refers to ‘the carnal weapons of Antichrist’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fnref35\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">35</a></sup></p>\n<p>Visited in April 1824 by another Indian convert, John, who had recently been baptised at Bangalore, the elder brother wrote to Flavel, asking for a meeting. Flavel told the European missionaries that when he arrived in Mysore, the Catholic congregation had been commanded by the priest not to speak to him, who described him as ‘the greatest devil he had known among the Protestants’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">36</a></sup></p>\n<p>The congregation reportedly tried to persuade the two brothers, whose father had been a Catholic, not to leave the church, offering to double their allowance as catechists. Unpersuaded, the letter suggests they were ‘treated with great contempt and abuse’, and given a kicking, which was ‘received as became the disciples of the meek and lowly Jesus’, praying for their attackers. The younger brother was accused by the crowd of saying they were the “Antichrist”, to which he replied that beating and flogging the pair received ‘fully proved that <em>they</em> deserved that name.’<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fnref37\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">37</a></sup></p>\n<p>The brothers then went to the Catholic Church ‘with a view to removing some images which were their private property, and which had formerly belonged to their father’, destroying all except that of the Virgin Mary.</p>\n<p>This had been embellished with jewels by ‘infatuated devotees’, especially one woman who believed Mary ‘had been propitious to her’. The congregation claimed the jewels as the property of the church, attempting to persuade the brothers to accept payment for statue, arguing that ‘if it were taken away, some curse would descend upon the congregation’ – some of the details of their offers were summarised in the paragraph that was quoted in the catalogue of the Missionary Museum.</p>\n<p>Turning a deaf ear, however, they:</p>\n<p>endeavoured to demonstrate with the poor infatuated people, showing the folly and sin of these offers, assuring them that they did not refuse their offers because the expected more money for it; but being aware of the danger of making it an object of worship, they felt, as the disciples of Christ, constrained to take it away.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fnref38\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">38</a></sup></p>\n<p>When they did so they were charged with further debts which were subsequently dismissed by a magistrate. Baptised by Samuel Flavel, they took the names Nathaniel<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fnref39\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">39</a></sup> and Jonas and travelled with him to Bangalore, presumably taking the statue of the Virgin Mary and infant Jesus with them.</p>\n<p>According to the letter signed by the three European missionaries, this was:</p>\n<p>the plain unvarnished tale of the conversion of these two men from the errors and superstitions of the Church of Rome, to the profession of the truth as it is in Jesus.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fnref40\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">40</a></sup></p>\n<p>Here, at last, was an ‘idol’ unambiguously ‘given up by former worshippers, from a full conviction of the folly and sin of idolatry’ in the East Indies section of the catalogue of the Missionary Museum. Rather than being a Hindu <em>murti</em> or Buddharūpa, however, it was an image of the Virgin Mary. It may have been given up through ‘a conviction derived from the ministry of the Gospel by the Missionaries’ although these Missionaries were not Europeans, but fairly recent Indian converts.</p>\n<p>The following month, in February 1826, the editors of the <em>Missionary Chronicle</em> returned to the Bangalore mission, printing another letter from the same three missionaries sent slightly earlier, on 15 May 1825. This described an encounter between Samuel Flavel and an Indian Catholic from Madras. Evidently ‘all that Samuel said was well received, till he spoke against praying to the Virgin Mary and departed saints’. The two men agreed to have a public disputation in the bazar, for which Samuel proposed four questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the faith of the Roman Catholic church the faith of the church of Christ?</li>\n<li>Is the church of Rome the church of Christ?</li>\n<li>Are its ceremonies, – such as bowing to the priests with their faces to the ground, counting their beads, and wearing crosses round their necks, the ceremonies of the church of Christ?</li>\n<li>Are its acts of worship,- such as bowing to images, ringing of bells, &amp;c. – lawful in the church of Christ?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fnref41\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">41</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Their conversations were evidently attended by sixty or seventy people, many of whom are referred to as ‘heathens’, and their meetings continued over more than a fortnight. According to the letter, the seriousness with which these events were approached made the European missionaries at Bangalore think:</p>\n<p>of the contests which, in the days of Luther and of Calvin, produced such effects in the western world; and we rejoiced in the hope that this might prove a commencement of the more certain and speedy overthrow of Antichrist in this distant land.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fnref42\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">42</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the translation and summary of the dialogue that was printed, the disputation centred on the accuracy of the translation of the second commandment, relating to graven images, with Flavel exclaiming that:</p>\n<p>I believe, then, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; that he is the only Mediator between God and Man; that he is the way, the truth, and the life; that he is able to save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him; and that he is the only Advocate who intercedes for us at the right hand of his Father.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fnref43\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">43</a></sup></p>\n<p>When challenged on the difference between worshiping and looking at images, Flavel’s Catholic interlocutor suggested that Protestant bibles also included pictures of Jesus Christ. Flavel’s counter was to volunteer to burn these images and say he rejected them if his interlocutor was prepared to do the same for Catholic images.</p>\n<p>The letter ends its account of the dialogue by stating that it was an imperfect translation ‘as Samuel speaks his own language not only very correctly, but often with elegance and eloquence’ – revealing the severe linguistic limitations that held back the preaching efforts of European missionaries in other parts of the world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fnref44\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">44</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is significant that both letters sent from Bangalore in 1825 end by outlining plans for Mysore College, a seminary that was intended to bring ‘forward pious native youth for the ministry of the gospel’.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fnref45\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">45</a></sup> The degree to which the London Missionary Society would support and embrace local Christian teachers, such as Samuel Flavel, would become a defining question for the Directors of the London Missionary Society, back in London.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fnref46\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">46</a></sup></p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>An earlier version of this chapter appeared in the Südasien-Chronik – South Asia Chronicle, together with Chapter 6, under the title ‘South Asian Artefactual Histories from the London Misisonary Society Museum, 1814-1826’. I am very grateful to Tobias Delfs for the invitation to contribute to the special issue of the journal on Christian mission in South Asia.</p>\n<p>As someone who is not a specialist on South Asia, I have been cautious venturing into this field, but in writing these artefactual histories I realised I had probably learnt more from tutorials in Oxford with Nicholas Allen and Clare Harris, as well as lectures by Richard Gombrich, than I had remembered.

It was also featured as a full-page reproduction in September 1936 issue of <em>Survey Graphic</em>, titled “Draggin’-Around People” and captioned “A blighted pea crop in California in 1935 left the pickers without work. This family sold their tent to get food.” Also in this issue was an article by Taylor entitled “From the Group Up.” His report on demonstration projects of the New Deal’s Resettlement Administration in Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and California was illustrated with four more picture by Lange.</p>\n<p>Since it was first published, this composition, best known as <em>Migrant Mother</em>, has come to represent not only the pictorial archive created by the RA/FSA during the 1930s but also the Great Depression itself. Posters and other publicity of later activists fighting racial, economic, and political oppression have borrowed from Lange’s icon of the time.

With Lange’s artistry, Owens took on the timeless quality of Eugéne Delacroix’s strong female rebel (<em>Liberty Leading the People</em>), Jean-François Millet’s peasant woman (the agrarian ideal), Honoré Daumier’s laundresses (the working woman) and Käthe Kollwitz’s proletarian woman warrior (one of the mothers leading her <em>Peasants’ War</em>).</p>\n<p>Owens, although she became famous, did not enjoy, even momentarily, the life of a celebrity. She had three more children and kept moving with her family, following the California crops. She did become involved in efforts to organize farm labor and would sometimes serve as the straw boss, one who negotiates wages for migrants as the picking season begins. She was still working in the fields at age fifty before finally marrying again (to George Thompson) and settling into a stable life in Modesto, California.</p>\n<p>Several Lange images from the same photoshoot with Owens and her children exist <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/migrant-mother/introduction\" target=\"_blank\">in other collections</a>. These give us the chance to consider the  many varied choices in composition that Lange made in producing her iconic final image.</p>\n<figure id=\"mother-variants\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-variants\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><canvas-panel canvas-id=\"http://localhost:8000/iiif/mother-variants/canvas\" choice-id=\"\" height=\"\" iiif-content=\"\" manifest-id=\"http://localhost:8000/iiif/mother-variants/manifest.json\" preset=\"responsive\" region=\"0,0,826,1024\" virtual-sizes=\"\" width=\"\"> </canvas-panel></a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-variants\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1.1</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Alternate versions of Dorothea Lange’s <em>Migrant Mother</em>, 1936.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure id=\"mother-annotations\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-annotations\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"/iiif/mother-annotations/base/static-inline-figure-image.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-annotations\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1.2</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">This version of the print from the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division is mounted on paper board and includes an original FSA label.

They traveled to the Deep South to prepare an article on tenant cotton farming. In Alabama they documented the lives of farmers, including the Fields family.
